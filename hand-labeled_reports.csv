Summary: On 12/30/11 [redacted] was preparing to wash clothes in her new Whirlpool washing machine. She poured bleach into a glass measuring cup. She then placed the glass measuring cup on the dryer while putting the top on the bleach bottle and placing the bleach bottle in the overhead cabinet.  Because of the curved downward slope of the top of the dryer sloping from back to front, the measuring cup containing bleach slid to the front of the dryer and fell to the floor, splashing bleach onto the floor, the rug in the laundry room, clothes hanging several feet away in the laundry room, and onto [redacted]specifically onto her legs, arms, hands and body.  She sustained bleach burns and swelling to her hands, arms and legs.  Property damaged included her shirt and pants, the rug in the laundry room, and clothes hanging in the laundry room.

Defect/Hazard in dryer and washing machine design: Forward downward slope of the tops causes objects placed on the tops to slide down and fall to the floor.  No warnings on any materials or on the washer or dryer warned against putting objects on the top of the dryer or washing machine.  No rim or other design feature prevents objects such as containers of liquids, clothes baskets, detergent boxes or containers from sliding forward down the sloping top and falling to the floor.  The risk is exacerbated by any moisture present on the top of the dryer/washer or on the bottoms of containers placed on the top of the dryer/washer.

Comment:  It is pure luck that the splash from the bleach did not enter [redacted] eyes. It is only a matter of time, however, before serious bodily injury results from caustic substances or objects slipping down and falling from the sloping tops of the Whirlpool Cabrio washer and dryer.",,Richmond,Virginia,23233,Home/Apartment/Condominium,"Injury, First Aid Received by Non-Medical Professional",Female,My Spouse,63,Yes,No,,,No,No,Yes,Will send a copy of my summary of the incident,"(1/25/2012) WHIRLPOOL CORPORATION: The Consumer Product Safety Commission has forwarded your report of an incident in which you identified a product from our Whirlpool Corporation brands.

It was the first time using this bat in a game and had only been used in two practices before this game. The bat is a two-piece bat, meaning it has a handle made of carbon fiber and a barrel made of metal. The connection between the barrel and the handle is covered by a red piece of plastic. 

My son swung the bat at a pitch that hit exactly on the red connecting piece of plastic. This plastic is an odd shape and has an angle that is not seen on other bats. The ball ricocheted off the plastic and into my sons eye, which was permanently damaged. 

The umpire, coach, players and my self with 30 years of experience have never seen a simple foul ball fly into the batter's face before. The fact this ball hit directly on the red attachment suggests strongly that the odd angle of this attachment is a contributor into this awful injury. 

Because of basic physics this bat design is suspect and I am dubious after this accident that this product has been tested for safety or if it was it was likely ignored by the bat company.

The Model is FRA064AT7 and the Serial Number is KK25142655.

My husband and I usually use the remote to turn on the air conditioner. However, one day this summer, my husband turned on the air conditioner by hand (instead of using the remote). He smelled a strong musty odor. He looked closely at the air conditioner and saw there was black mold on the vents (located on the front above the air filter), so he removed them and clean them. He also could see inside the air conditioner and saw the fan and other parts inside the body of the air conditioner had black mold, including the white Styrofoam inner shell. We do not know how long this black mold had been growing in the air conditioner.

My husband and I both experienced numerous mold-related health issues due to the mold inside the air conditioner. We didn't realize the health issues we were having were due to mold until we discovered the mold on the vents and in the air conditioner. After cleaning the mold off the vents (and regularly checking and cleaning them since then), the health issues have decreased. The mold still remained inside the body of the air conditioner.

The air conditioner's manual has Care and Cleaning instructions regarding the air filter and exterior cabinet only. It does not indicate that the vents (located on the front above the air filter) and the interior body of the air conditioner need to be cleaned. It is easy to remove the vents and clean them. However, it is quite a process to access the interior body of the air conditioner.

Suggestions: The manual should at least be updated to include the vents as a part that needs to be cleaned on a regular basis. Perhaps the interior components could be made of mold-resistant materials.

The mold that grew in this air conditioner is definitely a health issue for people. My husband and I do not own a pet, but I wonder if the mold could also cause health issues for pets.

Now that it is autumn and the temperatures are cooler, we have removed the air conditioner for the season. My husband took the air conditioner apart, and I took pictures.

I will attach photos of the inside of the air conditioner, pictures of the model/serial number tag on the outside of the air conditioner, and the Care and Cleaning instructions that are in the air conditioner manual. I have also attached a photo of the front of the air conditioner showing the vents that I refer to above. The vent photo shows them after they were cleaned and the air conditioner is ready for winter storage.

Several days after we had it installed, I started smelling a chemical smell, when the cold water was being used.  I am very sensitive to certain smells and it has made me feel ill whenever I smell it.  I have looked online and many other people with Moen kitchen faucets seem to have the same problem.
Because I wash my hands at the kitchen sink many times a day, make coffee with water from that faucet, as well as use it for cooking, I am very concerned as to what is causing the smell and how dangerous it may be.  I have read that people who have complained to Moen about this, have been told that it is the hose that is causing the problem, but people who have replaced the hose still have the same problem.

I noticed there was  a very strong plastic smell to it when I received the product, but the seller assured me it is common with new stoves. I did not attempt to use the stove until a camping trip on July 17, 2016. On July 17, 2016, I put cold water into the Jetboil cup and attached it to the Jetboil burner that is attached to Jetboil fuel canister. I made sure that the burner is at the lowest setting and pressed the igniter button that is supposed to automatically ignite the stove. 

What happened instead is I saw the whole stove go up in flames. I could not touch the stove or attempt to disconnect the fuel canister due to extremely high temperature and used whatever water I had at the campsite to put out the fire. Upon examination of the damage, I noticed that the igniter button completely melted off, plastic stand that the burner is attached to sustained substantial damage, and there was some damage to the wooden picnic table.  Upon first use, the whole plastic burner bottom went up in flames when I pressed the igniter. This sort of malfunction is a major safety issue, especially if I did not have access to water at the campsite (which is common on camping trips), the fire could ultimately lead to fuel canister explosion.

Our customer service, in accordance with our standard policy, reached out to the consumer, and requested that he return the unit so that we could conduct an inspection and determine the cause of the fire.

On August 4, 2016, we followed up with the consumer and sent prepaid postage information via email to retrieve the unit to inspect it.  We followed up the email with a telephone call.  He again refused our request to inspect the unit and said he would contact CPSC.  On August 5, the consumer informed us that he contacted the CPSC to report the incident.  As of this date, we still have not been afforded the opportunity to retrieve and inspect the incident unit to determine if the failure was due to a manufacturing or design issue, or post-sale damage or alterations to the unit, or user error.

It was not - the recall was for units with a plastic tub, ours is stainless steel.  I called the dealer where the unit was purchased and a repairman was assigned to help us.  When he took the panel off the door, the coating on the wires was melted and there was exposed  wiring.  He said it could easily have started a fire.  He said that many dishwashers were having trouble with the liquid rinse aid getting into the wiring, and this was possibly the result of that action.  The cost to repair the unit was $246.00.  We wonder why the stainless steel tub units were not included in the recall -- it is a serious safety matter and should be investigated.

On 7/21/12, the first time he used it he went to bed with the sleeping bag.  About 10 minutes after lights out, I checked to see if he was asleep yet and I didn't see his head, so I turned on the lights to see where he was and he was burrowed head first all the way into the bottom of the sleeping bag, (not with his head out the top of the bag as it should be, but totally upside down in the bag). Then he had apparently had rolled over so he was twisted tightly inside the sack. I had to roll him over to untwist and then unzip the bag to get him out.

The fabric is a tightly woven silky material and is insulated with a layer with fiber fill inside, so it has three layers of fabric (front, inside and back).  It's made to keep the cold air out, so obviously it's not porous and not much air gets through it. Our grandchild is a heavy, heavy sleeper, so apparently he didn't wake up when he got hot & sweaty.   When I saw that he was upside down in the bag I immediately, frantically unzipped and untwisted the bag to get him out, he was soaking wet (sweating), pale and very lethargic.  I believe if he'd been in there longer he would have suffocated. This is very dangerous for a child and poses a serious danger for suffocation. If he had been in there longer I think he would have probably passed out, suffocated and we wouldn't have found him until the next morning. 

This would be equally dangerous for a toddler or smaller child who also might crawl inside while playing.  This sleeping bag, which is geared for children (Disney Cars/Pixar design on fabric) should be recalled from the market immediately.  It is manufactured by Idea Nuova, Inc,.

The mower presently has 156 hours of use on it.

Blades are continuously coming loose and seat are separated from the metal frame.

He had the blades sharpened about 2007 at the Beards Simplicity Repair Facility where he purchased it and that is when the blades began coming loose.

[REDACTED] who is manager at same repair facility (Beards) advised caller that there was nothing they could do about the seat.                                                                                    

He has tightened blades with a impact gun which tightens tighter than recommended torque but they still come loose.  The factory bolt is too long.  It needs a washer or be made with a shorter bolt so the blades stay tight to torque against the blade.

 

Lawn mower seat began coming loose around 2009 just after the warranty ran out.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
He is reporting this lawn mower as a safety risk due to the ability of the blades to come out if he did not notice looseness and could injure someone and he could also fall out of the seat as it became completely loose from its frame.

He has not been able to contact the manufacturer because he states that they can only be contacted via email and he doesn't know anything about that.

As explained in the instructional materials that are enclosed with our product, Shape-ups are not like other athletic shoes. They employ a Smart Shoe rocker bottom sole and a unique soft Resamax kinetic wedge that require the wearer to exert additional effort to maintain balance. This additional effort activates muscles, particularly the leg muscles. Because Shape-ups operate on the principle of an unstable platform, users are advised to stand up straight, keep their weight centered, place their feet parallel and hip-distance apart, and walk at a comfortable pace, being sure to plant each heel firmly and roll forward on to the toes. Users are further advised to limit their use of Shape-ups to 25-45 minutes per day for the first two weeks of use, and to gradually increase usage time by 5-10 minute increments thereafter and only if comfortable to do so. Shape-ups are intended for low-intensity activities such as standing and walking, and not for running or vigorous sports. Skechers highly recommends consumers follow these and other instructions while using Shape-ups.

Within a week of his initial use of the humidifier, the consumer noticed a dust on his furniture and other items that were near the humidifier.  He initially did not think much of this.  

He used the product for approximately 7 weeks and 5 week into using the product, the consumer developed a hacking cough (similar to a smokers cough).  The cough also continued to get worse over time.

Some of this dust was being sucked into his return-air duct.  This is when he identified that this mist floated in the air and remained for an unidentified amount of time.

3/2/2018:  The home heating system shut down and stopped working.  The consumer had to get a technician out to examine it.  The first tech. did not correctly identify the problem.  

3/3/2018:  The consumer had a 2nd technician come out, who was more experienced.  This tech. was able to identify that particles from the humidifier were being trapped in the home heating system's return-air duct.  The tech. also said that the consumer's filter was very tight and able to trap these particles.  However, lower quality filters may allow the particles to go into this home heating/venting system and could impact its operation.

Within 1 - 3 days of discontinued use of the product, the consumer began to feel almost 100% better.

3/5/2018:  The consumer contacted the manufacturer and spoke with a Customer Service Rep. and reported the issue and asked if he could be reimbursed.  The rep. took the consumer's information and told him that a supervisor would call him back, but he had not received a call at the time of this report.


3/8/2018:  The consumer followed up with the manufacturer again.  The consumer believes that their warnings are misleading and he inquired about getting reimbursed again.  The rep. asked him questions and told him that she had to pass his information over to a supervisor.

The consumer is extremely concerned because if this product affected his heating systems filter, he questions what the  health effects would be to homeowners.

3/4/2018:  The consumer returned the product back to the retailer and reported the problem as well.  The retailer took the product back and gave him  a full refund.

I find that if I wiggle the knob, turn it all the way around a few times, the burner eventually turns off.  I stopped using the left side of my stove about 6 months ago, since I realized there were problems with the other side.  I haven't had the burners spontaneously light since permanently stopping use, although when I was heavily using them, I would wake up in the morning to find that the burner turned on again.  In addition, the back left burner does not fully heat.  

I did call Sears customer service about this issue several months back, explained the problem and was never told about the recall.  Although my model and serial # are not covered, one would think that Sears would be proactive about telling customers that this has happened with hundreds of thousands of stoves - I never gave them my product information.  I did some research that night and found that the issue I encountered was not an isolated incident.",,Boston,Massachusetts,2116,Home/Apartment/Condominium,"Incident, No Injury",Unspecified,Unspecified,,Yes,No,,,No,Yes,,I have the product and would like to have it repaired.

The fire was contained and remained inside the oven b/c we were at home and present when there was a popping noise and we smelled the electrical fire.  We turned the breaker off and the fire ceased.  However, black smoke billowed out of it for about 3 minutes.  There was no damage to anything other than the range.  It is worth noting that this is a lemon replacement from Sears and the first Kenmore Elite Electric Slide-in (a model No. 790.4670) that we had was tripping the breaker and burned the motherboard on the back of the range.",,Lowber,Pennsylvania,15660,Home/Apartment/Condominium,"Incident, No Injury",Unspecified,Unspecified,,Yes,,,,No,Yes,,Sears has been contacted (on the day of the fire) but we have not recieved a code for authorization to purchase yet another range.,"(7/13/2011) Sears Holdings Management Corporation: Sears Holdings takes product safety issues very seriously.
