1.	My hearing was muffled (lasted for 30-45 minutes)

After using the heater for about a month, on March 4, 2019, the heater stopped working. When I inspected the heater, I discovered that on the back panel, the vent had partially melted towards the top of the unit. This was alarming to me considering that I only used the heater for about two or three hours at a time at a temperature of no more than 72 degrees. (For reference, the lowest temperature of the heater is 65 degrees.) If I had been using this heater for longer periods of time or at higher temperatures, it's possible that the casing of the heater could have melted further and dripped into the heater itself, possibly causing a fire - or at least a fire hazard. I did some research online to see if anyone else has had a similar experience with their heaters of the same model. There are many complaints regarding the same issue posted by many reviewers on the product page for the unit on Amazon, where I purchased the heater. Some reviews include pictures showing damage from melting that is very similar to what I saw on my heater. A brand new heater should not be melting after one month of use for reasonable periods of time at relatively low temperatures. It appears that the problems that caused another Vornado heater to be recalled last year are still present in other units currently being sold. I would like for this issue to be investigated to ensure that this heater does not pose safety hazards to consumers.

I use it almost 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, however, because of a situation that caused me concern, I try very hard never to leave the unit running unattended without first turning off the heat.

1. When the unit tips forward onto its face, a safety switch located on the bottom always cuts the power as expected. This safety feature has never failed me.

2. When an object is placed too close, restricting the air flow, a thermal switch located inside cuts the power, and the power is not restored until the unit has sufficiently cooled. As far as I can tell, this safety feature appears to work consistently as well.

3. However, one day, after having owned this heater for approximately three to four years, the smell of burning plastic caught my attention, and I suddenly realized that the fan had stopped turning. I quickly turned off the unit which had become very hot to the touch. I later took the unit apart, lubricated the motor shaft and continued to use the unit. Within a year, the same situation occurred again. Since then, I have learned to continuously pay close attention to the sound of the fan, and whenever I hear it slowing down, I lubricate the motor shaft.

As an engineer, I had to say that the quality of the parts was underwhelming. 
   Months later, during the winter, the pressure contacts were heating up at the wires, glowing red hot, although seemed to be stable glowing like this but quite disconcerting having it in the house with the wife. ""Is it supposed to do that?"" was my first clue.

I believe in fixing what you have. 
  I brought in a few repair people to try to fix the problem. It didn't work. -The connections always wound up getting loose, causing increased resistance and glowing wires. Only it got worse, heating up more and more of the wire, shifting the heat output to just the topmost left of the unit. 

Not wanting to ""burn"" anymore time or money, I chucked it up to a loss and experience and sent the unit to my local plant to be recycled... that a few months later, the company calls me telling me about this fault. Alas.

I've called both apartments. They said you have to have the bottom of the unit for your CPSR to be allowed to take action. 

I am pleased to know my options are open and that this is a known issue
It's not critcial that action be taken for me personally, only that the engineers know and bulletproof the design more carefully in the future.

Dear valued Vornado Customer.

It is regrettable that you had a problem with your VH102 portable heater. Vornado has no outstanding safety issues regarding the plug or any other part on this model. The VH102 is built with protection devices to guard against abnormal operation, and uses a UL approved cord and plug. When a heater of any model is returned to Vornado, that heater is rigorously inspected and checked for functionality. We have not inspected your damaged unit. The cause of your damaged plug is therefore undetermined. Since a 1500W heater can draw upwards of 12.5 amps from a household outlet please ensure that the outlet is in good condition and the plug ends are in good condition by checking for pitting or damage. Please make sure the outlet is rated for the current draw, and that the outlet does not have other devices on the same circuit that will diminish the current rating of the outlet. 

Vornado makes safe and regulatory compliant portable heaters, and we do not anticipate any safety issues when used correctly. We conduct regular inspections of our product for quality assurance on each production run, and  we are confident that the products we manufacture are built with the highest attention to consumer safety.",,"['Vornado ', 'Vornado Air LLC']","['AM', '15', '9PM']",0

After around 10 minutes of use, the steam started coming out very slowly then stopped.  At this point I was done cleaning so I turned off the unit off. 

I checked for pressure in the unit by squeezing the trigger for the cleaning nozzle.  Nothing came out so I assumed the unit was not under pressure.  I decided to remove the hose and unscrewed the knob attaching the hose to the main unit, suddenly without warning the hose blew off and sprayed steam and hot water on my forearm, wrist and thumb.  

I immediately put my arm under cold running water but every time I removed it from the cold water, the pain was unbearable, so I had to return it to the water.  I got an ice pack wrapped in a towel but the texture of the towel was also very painful on the arm.  I ended up keeping my arm in a bucket of ice water for the entire day until I decided to go to the Palo Alto Medical Center Urgent Care facility.  The doctor dressed the wound with and gave me codeine pain medication.  

Since there is no warning label about removing the hose, I thought there must be a one way valve on the main body of the SF275 to prevent the discharge of steam from the unit when the hose is removed, and because the hose is attached with a simple unsecured knurled knob, it seemed like a user friendly device, not a accident waiting to happen. Even though I was careful in checking for steam pressure by squeezing the trigger for the nozzle I needlessly suffered 1st degree burns on my arm.

If the SF-275 a 2 cent warning label or a $3 check valve on the output port this accident never would have happened.",Redwood City,California,94061,Home/Apartment/Condominium,"Injury, Emergency Department Treatment Received",Male,Self,56,Yes,,,,,Yes,,They told me I was at fault.,"(11/20/2012) Vornado Air LLC: This is in response to Report #20121030-DEBA1-2147462373.

Although annoying this could result  in a fire if near an ignition source. i have had problems with these ""flip style"" caps in the past - on other Stihl models. This most recent saw had a cap that would not seal after many diliberate attampts to insert and close the mechanism carefully. The leakage resulting from these poorly performing fuel caps could result in an unessacary burn to the saw operator leg. A similar Stihl fuel cap has been the subject of a recall on other types of Sthil power equipment, chainsaws for some reason, were not included. These Sthil ""flip type"" fuel and oil caps are not reliably capable of preventing a fuel spill onto the operator and also into the environment. A saw fully fueled and left to sit on the ground could conceivably discharge the contents of the tank over - say - a lunch break. Problems with these caps have been ongoing for many years and are well know within the industry  - a Google search of Stihl fuel caps returns some discussion of the shortcomings of this overly complex and fragile design. Screw type fuel caps have been successfully used for decades on many types of equipment requiring a fuel tank and a cap used for sealing the tank. The principles and utility of a screw cap are well understood. Common sense could lead one to believe that Sthil's ""flip type"" caps have not proven themselves - to be able to be used correctly - as Stihl may assert - and or  to reliably retain the contents of the fuel and oil tanks.

A STIHL dealer recently inspected the BG 55 blower (the blower) that you claim was leaking fuel, and he was unable to verify the existence and location of any such fuel leak.  The dealer noted several issues with the maintenance of your blower, including the fact that the blowers air filter was clogged and dirty and had not been properly maintained in accordance with the instructions in the blowers Instruction Manual.  The dealer serviced your blower and cleaned the air filter.  

We had requested that you bring the blower in to your local dealer for inspection at the time we first received notice of your report to the CPSC.  Some weeks later, you informed the dealer that you wanted to continue to use the blower for blowing leaves and brought it in after you no longer needed it for that purpose this season. However, if the blower was leaking fuel, it should have been inspected before being used again.  Please remember that the BG 55s Instruction Manual warns against the use of damaged or improperly assembled blowers.  

Our records show that you have owned your blower since October 2009 without any prior reports of leaking.  A number of factors unrelated to the blowers design could have caused fuel to leak from the BG 55, including poor maintenance, improper use or improper installation of the fuel cap.  Any fuel cap will leak if not properly installed.  Please check the BG 55s instruction manual which provides detailed instructions on fueling as well as instructions on properly opening and closing the fuel cap.

We have inspected the sprayer and did in fact find the leak you reference in the bottom seam. However there was no indication that the seams are coming apart.  We noted that the sprayer was six years old at the time of this incident, and you had not reported any prior problems with it.  After a careful examination of this sprayer we have concluded that the leak is most likely due to damage and not to the sprayers design or manufacture.  There are a number of events explained in the Instruction Manual that can cause damage and possible leakage with these sprayers, including external impacts, corrosive/caustic chemicals and improper storage under pressure or with chemicals in the tank.  

We appreciate you bringing this to our attention.  As we recommend in the Instruction Manual for your STIHL sprayer, the operator should always to check for leaks prior to using it, particularly if there is any indication of damage, and discontinue use immediately if a leak is found.

My gardener has used a chain saw for 20 years and this is a new saw that he said kicked into his left hand the same way the week before the accident.

The MS 192 TC is a professional-use chain saw powerhead.  Like all STIHL chain saw powerheads, it is intended for two-handed operation.  It is our understanding that you claim that the saw caught and kicked, contacting the operators left hand and resulting in an injury.  As the Instruction Manual for the chain saw points out, reactive forces such as kickback may occur when the moving saw chain near the upper quadrant of the bar nose is suddenly stopped by contact with any solid object such as a log or branch or is pinched  possibly resulting in loss of control and serious personal injury.  The Instruction Manual also makes clear that, in order to reduce the risk of loss of control, the saw should always be held with two hands, with the left hand on the front handle bar.  In this position, it is impossible for a kickback to contact the operators left hand.  It is, therefore, much more likely that the operator was improperly holding the saw with only one hand and may have improperly been holding a nearby branch with his left hand.   

We were unsuccessful in our attempts to contact the operator of the chain saw at issue in this accident.  We encourage him to contact STIHL directly at 1-800-GO-STIHL and press 2 for Technical Services.  Learning more about this accident will help us determine what may have caused it. We thank you for calling this matter to our attention.

For instance, we cannot determine several important items from the description of the incident that was submitted.  It is unclear what the cause of the fuel leakage was or its location.  In addition, there is no record that, in the three-and-a-half years since your purchase, anyone ever brought the chain saw in for service, parts or repair.   

A number of factors could have caused fuel to leak from the chain saw including poor maintenance, improper use or not installing the fuel cap properly.  All fuel caps will leak if not properly installed.  In addition, when transporting the chain saw, it must be properly secured to avoid fuel spillage.  Please take your chain saw to your local STIHL servicing dealer and have it inspected.  The chain saw fuel cap or fuel filler opening at issue could have been damaged and in need of repair or a fuel line could have been loose or the fuel tank could have developed a crack from having been dropped. The sooner you take the unit to your dealer, the sooner the cause of the leak can be determined and remedied.   

For your information, you can find detailed instructions, guidance and cautions in your STIHL chain saw instruction manual including instructions on fueling your chain saw and properly opening and closing the fuel cap.

Once the saw was started the employee revved the engine twice and the saw exploded in the area of the fuel tank catching the saw on fire and the employees left leg (and chaps) on fire. The employee threw the chain saw to the ground and started rolling to put out the fire on his leg. He was assisted by another employee in the area and the fire dept. and medical services were called for assistance.

The employee was wearing the proper PPE (gloves, chaps, safety glasses, hearing protection). 

After the incident was over the chain saw was inspected by the employees co-workers and the safety department. 

The Stihl web site was researched and found that there was a ""Fuel Cap"" recall but the chain saw was not listed in the recall. The recall stated that the caps being replaced would have a molded letter ""D"" or lower on it and the new caps would have a ""E"" or higher on it. The caps on the saw involved in the incident (and one other saw of the same model) both had the letter ""D"" on the inside of the cap.

The Stihl phone number for the fuel cap recall was called and they were informed of the incident that had occurred with the saw and that a fuel cap with the letter ""D"" was on the saw at the time of the incident.

The Stihl representative stated that there were caps on other pieces of equipment that were similar to the recalled caps and that the cap could be replaced at no charge if the cap was taken to a local distributor.

Our concern was that there is a possibility that there are still defective caps on their equipment and that there could possibly be more incidents / injuries because of these caps.",Norfolk,Virginia,23511,Place of Recreation or Sports,"Injury, Emergency Department Treatment Received",Male,Unspecified,,Yes,No,,,No,Yes,,Contacted Stihl to inform them of the incident with their chainsaw.,"(10/9/2012) STIHL, INC.: At STIHL Incorporated, safety is a top priority, and we are sorry to hear that your employee was involved in an accident while using a STIHL chain saw.  We have been trying to contact you with respect to this report, but, so far, have not heard back from you.  We would like to understand more about the accident and its causes.  For instance, we cannot determine several important items from the description of the incident that was submitted and the accompanying pictures.  From the photos it appears the fuel cap was not installed in the fuel filler opening at the time of this accident.  This suggests that the fuel cap was never properly installed.  Because no picture of the fuel cap was included, we cannot tell if it was damaged prior to the accident.  It also would be beneficial to have information on the last time the machine had been refueled, since fuel could have been spilled on the chain saw and the operator at that time.  Finally, because of the richness of the gasoline-to-air mix in the fuel tank, an explosion cannot take place inside the tank, so we would like to speak to the reporter to try to understand what he did observe.

While it is correct that STIHL voluntarily recalled certain products in cooperation with the CPSC on May 25, 2011, it was not as you indicate, due to defective [fuel] caps.  Those products were recalled specifically because the levels of ethanol, aromatics or other additives in some gasoline can distort parts of the fuel cap, which sometimes makes the caps more difficult to install and/or remove.  Your description of the incident, however, does not indicate that the operator had been experiencing problems installing or removing the fuel cap on the machine.

As STIHL makes it clear in its Instruction and Safety Manuals, it is important always to check for fuel leakage before and during usage of any gasoline powered tool and in the event of fuel or oil leakage not to start or run the engine until the leak is fixed.  If fixing the leak involves anything more than properly reinstalling the cap, operators should take the equipment to a STIHL dealer for inspection and any necessary repairs.

Following fueling and operation over various times the engine begins to bog down.  Upon loosening the fuel cap fuel spews out of the two vent holes in the cap for a distance of approximately 2-3 feet. If the cap is further loosened fuel under pressure comes out around the threads. The total amount discharged is estimated to be ½ to 1 pint. 
Once the pressure is relieved the engine operation returns to normal, until the pressure rises and has to be relieved. If the pressure is relieved while the unit is on the operators back there is great risk of fire and serious/catastrophic consequences to the operator and others nearby.
The fuel cap was replaced with a factory manufactured cap, however, the problem persists. The unit was returned to a factory authorized repair shop on two occasions where no defect was found.  Following both occasions the unit was placed in service again with the same problem re- occurring after being refueled several times. 
The users manual states (page 15):  Warning: In order to reduce the risk of burns or other personal injury from escaping gas vapor or fumes remove the fuel filler cap carefully so as to allow any pressure build up in the tank to release slowly. The above events far exceed vapor and fumes.
The unit is not serviceable due to the extreme hazard to its operator.
I have attempted to contact Stihl via E-Mail (the only way I know how, however, they have not replied). The authorized dealer says that nothing can be done as they are not able to duplicate the event in their shop.

I have had my clothing and shoes soaked with not only gasoline/oil mixture, but also chain saw bar oil,  which also has a resivoir that uses the same cap design.   In my opinion Stihl needs to be pressured to include their saws in this recall, as they are just as much of a safety hazard as the other products included in the recall.

At STIHL Incorporated, safety is a top priority, and we are sorry to hear that you experienced fuel and oil leakage while operating your STIHL chain saw. Without additional information we cannot determine the exact reason for your problem.  However the fact that you were having difficulty with both the oil and fuel filler caps on your chain saw suggests that the caps were not closed properly or could be damaged.  With a seven-year-old machine, even normal wear and tear obviously can affect the performance of various components. 

Per our Instruction and Safety Manuals, (which are available from any authorized STIHL dealer or downloadable at www.stihlusa.com) you should never start or run any STIHL product in the event of fuel leakage.  Please stop using your chain saw immediately and take it to your nearest servicing STIHL dealer (www.stihldealer.net/locator), who will be able to correct the problems you identified and inspect your chain saw for any needed repairs or maintenance.   

Please note that the STIHL products voluntarily recalled by STIHL in cooperation with the CPSC on May 25, 2011 (the Recall) were recalled because the levels of ethanol, aromatics or other additives in some gasolines at times made fuel caps more difficult to install or remove, and not, as you noted, due to a faulty gas cap design.  For that reason, the Recall did not include oil filler caps, which are not exposed to ethanol or other fuel additives.

We are sorry to hear that you were experiencing problems operating your MS 290 chain saw.  Our records indicate that this unit was purchased in April 2011 and was recently serviced by your local STIHL dealer.  According to our records, the STIHL mechanic noticed that the torsion spring that is part of the Master Control Lever connecting the throttle trigger and the throttle interlock was bent.  The mechanic determined that the torsion spring had been bent as the result of an improper starting procedure for the chain saw.  

The Instruction Manual for the MS 290 (which can be downloaded here: http://www.stihlusa.com/information/info_product2.html) contains specific instructions on how to properly start its engine with the chain brake engaged.  It outlines that when initially moving the Master Control Lever to either the cold start or warm start position, the operator must first press down the throttle trigger interlock and squeeze the throttle trigger at the same time.  Also, after pulling the starter grip, if the engine begins to pop or fire, the Master Control Lever must be moved to the warm start position (if not already set there) before continuing to pull the starter cord.  As soon as the engine starts to run, the operator must immediately depress the throttle trigger interlock and blip or squeeze the throttle trigger which causes the Master Control Lever to move to the Run position and returns the engine to its regular idling speed.  

Forcing the Master Control Lever into the initial starting position described above, or into the Run position without first simultaneously depressing the throttle trigger interlock and throttle trigger will create excessive force on the torsion spring.  Based on the mechanics inspection, he determined that the bent torsion spring resulted from the repeated forcing of the lever.   Following the proper starting procedure should prevent this from re-occurring.

The plugged-up condition of the spark arresting screen most likely led to an increase in the temperature of the FS 75s engine, muffler and outer shroud covering the muffler.  

As outlined in the Instruction Manual for the FS 75, STIHL recommends that the spark arresting screen be inspected after finishing work daily and cleaned as required to ensure the engine and the muffler do not overheat and to maintain proper engine performance.      

If you have any questions or concerns about the safety or performance of any STIHL products, please contact us directly at 1-800-GO-STIHL and press 2 for Technical Services.  We thank you for calling this matter to our attention.

I have one of these, Model BR550.  On at least 2 occasions, I filled the unit with gasoline, replaced the fuel cap which seemed to go on oddly but looked tight.  After starting the unit and putting it up on my back, I felt gasoline spilling down my leg.  As an emergency physician myself, I decided on the second event to quit using the unit and took it to the local dealer and complained.  He acted like he knew there was a problem and immediately replaced the gas cap.  This was last fall.  This seems to have corrected the problem.

I am thankful that this is being recalled before someone gets badly burned by this defect; however, Stihl should have a MANDATORY recall of these products.  If any questions, give me a call.

While you indicated that the replacement fuel cap you received appears to have corrected the issue with your BR 550, the BR 550 was one of a number of STIHL products that were voluntarily recalled by STIHL in cooperation with the Consumer Product Safety Commission on May 25, 2011.  

The Recall addresses potential hazards associated with distortion of some toolless fuel caps utilized on certain STIHL products due to abnormal fuel mixtures in some parts of the U.S.  Therefore, it is important that you immediately stop using your BR 550 and bring it to an authorized STIHL dealer so that they can determine whether a replacement of your fuel cap is necessary.

At STIHL Incorporated, safety is a top priority, and we are sorry to hear that you were injured while using a STIHL product.  To help us better understand your experience, please contact us directly at 1-800-GO-STIHL and press 2 for Technical Services.

It is our understanding that the throttle trigger of the chain saw had been repaired just prior to the accident, and you believe the repair may have contributed to the accident. During our inspection of your employers chain saw, however, we were unable to replicate any sticking of the throttle trigger. We did note that the chain saw had been heavily used and not well maintained.  Among other things, the muffler was loose, an AV spring was broken and there were large quantities of debris and saw dust in the air box and around the throttle linkage/master control switch.  

We hope that we will have the opportunity to speak with you directly.  Learning more about your accident will help us determine what may have caused it.  We thank you for calling this matter to our attention.

I am writing to make a revelation for #IKEA tempered glass mug explosion suddenly# under regular use conditions! And hurt my face with 4 stitches and broken my tooth, multiple soft tissue injuries in the body and mild concussion.

I just got up to have some water, used IKEA glass mug which made of tempered glass, suddenly it exploded beside the mouth while I was drinking. There are already several IKEA glass explosion accidents before mine in Micro-blog hot searching, But IKEA did not make any corresponding emergency measures and instructions. IKEA is a large multinational, glass mug as its star product with impressive sales. A large number of people use it. Since the glass mug were so widely used, but IKEA did not have to make any cautions and usage direction, even this mug still on sale in IKEA store.

The IKEA Store where I bought this mug is dealing with procrastination now, and said cannot identify the responsibility for the accident, and said this product has been sent to have a test and there is no quality problem. If there is no quality problem, why would I be disfigured by used it to just drinking water?The glass mug was not sold only at the one store but also sold around the world, I just want to know if the IKEA could be responsible for the quality and safety of their customer. 

I used to be a loyal user and big fan of IKEA,always went to IKEA center for shopping. There are thousands of people are loyal customers of IKEA around the world like me. As a victim, I know the destructive force of tempered glass mug explosion, and I hope there will be no more injuries for the same reason. 

There are some pictures for my injury, the situation of glass explosion in my home and some other peoples` explosion with the mail attachments. I had already collected at least 150 victims situation of glass explosion about IKEA glass, if you need I will be pleased to provide them for you.

I appreciate it very much if you could follow this accident and warn other people about the glass,it is really dangerous. Thank you for your consideration and I will be looking forward to your reply.

Yours sincerely

I recently placed 2 wine glasses on the top shelf of one of the cabinets and the entire shelf instantly failed in such a way that all of the wine glasses on that shelf (about 13-15 glasses) came crashing out of the cabinet towards me and down onto my floor. Normally, my small child is playing on this floor right where the glass fell, but luckily was not home at the time. The glasses shattered all over my floor, where my dog and I were standing. As this occurred, the edge of the shelf hit the top of my left eye socket and caused bruising and pain to the bone and surrounding tissue for over a week.

Method of shelf failure: The front edge of the shelf dropped past/inside the front 2 shelf supports, much like a trap door would open in a floor, allowing the shelf to fall forward.

Reason for shelf failure: The shelf is not deep enough to ensure it remains positioned on the front 2 shelf supports, and the 2 front shelf supports which extend from the back of the front face of the cabinet (rather than from the traditional location of the side of the cabinet, as do the 2 back supports) do not extend into the cabinet long enough to ensure they hold the shelf.

I checked all 5 other shelves of these two cabinets and this failure mode does not occur with the other shelves because the shelves are sufficiently deep to ensure they remain on the front shelf supports.

I also noticed that the back of the shelving unit ""gives"" a little behind where the failing shelf sits.

The lamp contains 3 standard screw-in type light bulbs. IKEA recommends LED light bulbs (which is what I used in my lamp). The lamp is attached to an electrical box that's typically already in the ceiling and is turned on/off by standard wall switch that would normally already be present.,"Furniture, Furnishings & Decorations",Indoor Lighting,Electric Chandeliers or Other Attached Light Fixtures (628),628,"IKEA North America Services, LLC",IKEA Calypso Ceiling Lamp,Article Number: 000.324.16,,,,,IKEA store,,7/11/2017,,"IKEA Calypso Ceiling Lamp breaks into razor sharp glass shards when removing the glass shade to clean it or to change light bulbs and has caused lacerations on both my hands. This lamp is a fairly new product and is still on store shelves as of today (10/12/2017). By searching on-line reviews I have found that the glass in this lamp is breaking on it's own without anything coming in contact with it for lots of other people. I believe it is due to stress in the glass from the light going from cold to hot and back again when the lamp is turned on and off, and that IKEA designers may have over compensated in how tightly the glass is held in the metal clips that hold the glass in place, possibly because in a previous ceiling light model, the glass was just releasing and falling to the floor. This lamp DOES NOT have that problem. The problem with this lamp is the glass just spontaneously fractures in one's hands, even if held very gently.

This is a totally separate and new issue from the previously recalled IKEA Ceiling Lamps even though the issue sounds similar at first. This is a newer, redesigned ceiling lamp.

When the glass shade / shroud needs to be removed for either cleaning or changing out light bulbs, this rather large piece of curved glass just spontaneously falls into many razor sharp pieces in one's hands, probably due to stress fractures that develop in the glass from the lamp during use. The real danger here is that if someone is removing the glass from underneath it while looking up, the glass will just fall into that person's face, or will injure children that may be playing on the floor nearby.

As far as I can tell, this seems to be happening to a lot of people who own this product based on some online reviews I've found. I've contacted IKEA, and they appear to me to be unconcerned. They offered me a refund and a $50 store certificate, which I've refused to take.

I have a science and engineering background, and from my perspective there is nothing that can be done to safely remove the glass shroud from this lamp without it breaking in owner's hands causing injury. It is a defective design and uses brittle, non-tempered glass. Someone is going to get seriously hurt when cleaning or changing a light bulb in this Calypso Ceiling Light product, possibly losing an eye in the process. 

This will be a difficult problem to solve for IKEA I predict in that the risk of injury occurs when removing the glass shade. If the product is recalled, then owners will have to do just that, remove the glass, to return it back to IKEA. And it's when the glass is removed that it'll turn into razor sharp shards right in one's hands.

Please please have something done about this dangerous product before someone gets seriously injured. I had received both lacerations and puncture wounds in both hands when removing the glass to clean it, and I was being very very careful with it.

Tempered glass is used for increased safety. If tempered glass breaks, it breaks with a shattering noise. This can be perceived as quite dramatic and causes small cubical glass pieces to spread widely. However the pieces are rarely sharp, contrary to normal glass, which breaks into long, sharp slivers that can cause serious cuts. Sometimes the tension caused by a strike, a knock or a scratch stays in the glass. A very small impact can make the glass shatter, hours or even months later. This is why glass at rare occasions may seem to shatter for no apparent reason.

The glass topper had spontaneously and violently shattered, throwing shards of glass in a five foot radius around the TV stand! There had been no signs of damage when I installed this item, nor had the glass sustained any damage after installation. There is absolutely no reason the glass should have shattered like this. There were no injuries, but only because nobody was in the room when this incident occurred.

I had a horrific headache the following day but on Wed June 29, 2016 I took a piece of the glass to the Calgary IKEA store, they returned the purchase price of the desk and said they would contact IKEA Sweden. July 4, 2016 I received a call from the Calgary IKEA store to say this is the normal reaction to a tempered glass table breaking. It is
impossible to believe this is true. I have glass shards imbedded everywhere - I have seen an eye doctor who reports there are no corneal lacerations on my eyes but there is debris in my eyes. I am being treated for that. I play the piano and my hands are of concern. The fine shards of glass in my hands are slowing coming out of the skin - I can still play.

We've had it for about 3 years my son is now old enough to use it and we have been using it as a toy storage now that he's older instead of hanging his clothes. He keeps his little cars in the bottom drawer and while playing opening the drawer and playing in it the whole wardrobe fell over on top of him. I luckily heard him scream and was able to run to him and lifted it off of him. We looked up the model to see if there was a recall and all we found were pre cautionary directions to secure it to the wall which we then did but prior to the incident we didn't realise this was a issue. We will never buy from Ikea again because literally every piece of furniture has the same caution and says to secure it to the wall. After this experience I am scared and will stay away and heed the warning as the furniture. I am blessed to have heard his scream as well as happy it wasn't my 2 year old he wouldn't have been strong enough to hold it up from crushing him. Luckily we just had to clean up a little blood from the top of his head and use some neosporin. I just wanted to inform everyone else of this.

- Induction cooktops are extremely energy efficient, fast and precise as induction technology transfers energy directly into magnetic cookware.
- The power booster feature (P) delivers additional power to a single cooking zone. This kind of rapid intense heat is ideal for boiling water, stir frying food or searing meat.
- The touch/press control panel allows you to regulate the heat easily and precisely by just touching the + and  symbols.
- You have excellent control when you cook since the individual timers allow you to time each zone separately.
- Pause function allows you to suspend the cooking process if you're interrupted, then re-start again at the same temperature in an instant. When the pause function is activated the cooking zone is automatically switched to the keep warm setting.
- Easy to clean by just wiping with a damp cloth or sponge as spills from food or liquids do not burn on the surface.
- A heat indicator shows when the cooking zone has cooled so that you are not in danger of burning yourself.

Professionally installed in April 2011 and started using it in May 2011 in a remodeled kitchen.  Mid November 2011 after using the unit approx 50 times, I had just finished cooking a dinner for 6 guests and had been using the unit for 90 minutes or so, whereupon I de-powered the unit by turning the normal master power switch off on the burner control panel as I normally would do when I finished cooking.  Twenty minutes into dinner I noticed an acrid burning electric insulation smell from the kitchen and grey smoke coming from the edges of the cook top where it sat upon the granite counter top.  I lifted the cook top and the area below spontaneously burst into open flames.  My dinner guest had the where-with-all to bring me a halon fire extinguisher with which I extinguished the flames and my wife turned off the 220 volt feeder circuit breaker at the electric panel.  Upon examining the area of the fire I noticed the feeder cables and the electronics area of the unit were nearly melted and destroyed by the fire.  There was absolutely no grease or food spillage or any other combustible matter in the area of the fire.  If I had not been at home that evening, I am certain my condominium would have been destroyed by the electrically fed fire which had started.  Whirlpool appliance replaced the unit in February 2012 and the appliance repair technician said that in his opinion the fire had been caused by a fault in the electronic control unit which had improperly commanded full power from a de-powered unit.  The new unit functioned normally until August of 2014 whereupon a fault light caused one of the elements to become permanently inoperative.  Whirlpool then replaced that unit with the third NUTID cook top and that one has been in service for about 14 months now.  I would have reported this earlier but I only found your web site recently.  Here is the information on the NUTID cook top as cut and pasted from the IKEA web site:

Last year I bought a memory foam mattress and felt sick for months. I did not realize at the time that memory foam mattresses could make people sick. I had moved into a new house and I did not know the cause of my sickness. It felt like the air was thick, and it smelled. It was a ""chalky"" smell. I thought it might be the renovation dust, so I spent the next several weeks cleaning for a few hours each day. I wiped down the walls, vacuumed, and even got an air purifier. 

I was so sick that I was in a daze for that entire month. I could hardly think straight. I was just blindly cleaning and trying to purify the air in my spare time. I researched ""air scrubbers."" I went to other people's houses to sleep. When I spent an entire day away, my head was able to clear and that is when I researched memory foam mattresses and realized their dangers. 

I had put sheets and a mattress pad on the mattress as soon as I unwrapped it, so it had not had time to air out. However once I realized the mattress was making the air in the house like this, I tried to air out the mattress. I left a fan on and the window open to keep the air circulating out. 

However, after a few more weeks, I still felt sick. I had stopped sleeping in that room and slept in a separate room when I found out, on an air mattress. The rest of the house aired out considerably, though not completely. I was able to contain the problem somewhat to the bedroom. But I still felt ill. After a few weeks I gave up. I dragged the mattress back to Ikea and returned it (it was just under their 90 day return policy).

I have multiples baby textile duvet covers in my house I bought them last year and year before in IKEA via internet/
online order or in the store in New Haven, CT.

Please note that duvet covers for children have to be redesign and recall immediately. I think they have very poor
design. All duvet covers sold for children are unprotected.

Please note that all of IKEASs duvet covers for children were sold without zipper/ buttons/ snaps that would protect
child from strangulation/ choking hazard.

Please note that: I have two kids in the house: 2 years old daughter and 5 months old son. My 5 months old son, [REDACTED] was left alone in the crib for few minutes at my house, in the crib was duvet cover and the pillow. In the
duvet cover was comforter. When I went to the kitchen and got back his head was inside of the duvet cover. He was
screaming and crying- looking for an air. Each of IKEAs duvet covers has a hole-left that is use insert comforter.
Duvet covers for children / babies sold either online in USA or in the store are unprotected and dont include snaps/
zipper/ or buttons to close the comforter inside and protect any child around the globe.

Duvet covers for adults sold in IKEA have snaps, I am not sure why for kids they dont.

If my child would be left for few more minutes could either suffocation himself or strangle himself.

The incident that happened at my house could happened to my daughter who is 2 years old daughter as well because
she can feat it. The incident happened in 6/15/2015. The incident that happened was very dramatic and cause me and
my son lots of stress.

I emailed IKEA and they told me that I may be asked to send them all duvet covers that are in my house, but this is not
resolving the issue which is still selling the duvet covers in the stores or online.

It shattered /exploded on Monday June 1 2015. There was nothing on the desk, or near it that could have caused it to shatter the way it did. I found a report online of a woman who had a very similar experience as mine, except I was sitting at the desk when it occurred. Also, unlike the report and Ikea's insistence, the glass did not just shatter in safe cubes, it shattered into shards and powdered glass which was everywhere!! 
I have spoken with Ikea as well as their insurance company. I do not want anything in the form of monetary compensation, however Ikea is not accepting this is a safety hazard and the product should be recalled. It is ridiculous that a product that has the potential to do this can be deemed safe and only a quality issue instead of a safety issue. There are small children in the home and i am certain if they were in the room they would have been hurt because of the way height that the glass exploded and that it landed everywhere.

Other reports very similar if not identical to what I experienced.

After some research, this has happened to many customers with Ikea's glass desks and no recall has been issued. I am still in conversations with Ikea in attempts to work out a solution. I have also requested a professional cleaning allowance, as this room will soon be my brand new baby's room.

Beech Finish,Baby,Nursery Equipment & Supplies,Nonportable Cribs (1543),1543,"IKEA North America Services, LLC",Ikea,502.485.41,,,,,"IKEA store - Stoughton, MA",Massachusetts,3/24/2014,,"I purchased an IKEA Snigglar crib (item # 402.485.41) on 3/24/14. I had purchased the same model crib approximately 3 years ago though the model has been updated by removing the particle board from the under-mattress support and replacing it with mesh netting (a nice upgrade in my mind given the chemicals often found in particle board). All of the crib assembled easily except the last bolt that attaches the mattress support frame to the crib sides by passing through an eye-hook. The bolt would not pass through the eye-hook because either the eye-hook hole was drilled at the wrong angle or the bolt hole was drilled in the wrong place. 

I called IKEA and after a long time on hold spoke with a customer service representative. When I explained the situation, she seemed familiar with the type of issue and suggested that the hole was drilled at the wrong angle. Rather than offering a solution, I was required to go through an extensive process for the store to find the receipt (I did not save mine though I do have the registration card, the crib, and the directions) and am now being told that while they found the receipt, it will be the local store's perogative as to whether they take care of the problem. ""Although we are providing a copy of the transaction information for your purchase, we cannot guarantee the outcome of the return, exchange, or warranty claim.  In all instances, the decision is solely at our Stores discretion once the item is physically inspected inside our Store Location."" (quote from IKEA customer service rep email.)

I am writing to let you know (1) about this issue which could cause the mattress support frame to fall in this corner (the eye-hook is not screwed in and could bounce out over time) and (2) to note IKEA's surprising lack of concern about this problem. I chose the snigglar crib because it is simply made and has no finish on it and value IKEA's better than average committment to safety and low-impact chemicals, but was very surprised by this experience and wanted to share it with your organization.

2 months ago, I noticed that the bottom part of the crib is completly sagging and bowing down. At the beggining it was in the middle but quickly it was all of the frame, there is almost a huge gap under the bottom rail of the crib (the crib is in the lowest position).

The reason for this is a decidedly poor design, in that the entire board is only attached to the crib frame at the four corners. there is absolutely no support at the middle of the crib.

I had the tea candle lit and it was over 1/2 way burned when it suddenly flared and there was a huge flame- of 6 inches or more whatever it scared the daylights out of me and I only noticed it because of the noise it made when it did it.  I had it in one of the IKEA bookcase cubbies so the chance of catching fire was huge.  I carefully brought it to my sink and was able to douse it but the flame was huge and it was scary.  It was in a  glass tea light holder which was crystal. I could not see anything amiss with the remains.  The foil holder was soft, but not melted.  I don't use candles often so this package is from awhile ago as they sell in bulk.  I would think it was an aberration but a couple of years ago (same package of candles) the same event happened.  I was close by and again noticed it because of the sound, but I recall it was dicey when removing it from the bookcase to take to a place to extinguish it.  Again the same flare and huge fan I think that was even higher almost reaching the top of their cubby bookcase which thankfully does not appear to be too flammable.  I had almost stepped out to do my laundry in the basement. If I had there would definitely have been a fire in the case in the past.

I am writing to inform you of a serious concern I have regarding IKEA glass desk tops. I purchased two glass desk tops December 29th 2012 for my kids study room. This past Saturday 12/7/13, when no one was in the room there was an explosion. We all rushed upstairs and to our amazement one of the desk glass table tops had not simply just shattered but had actually exploded and in the process thrown small pieces of glass across the entire room. Note this room is carpeted, so this is not a case where glass fell to the floor and somehow momentum caused it to slide. In order to land where the glass pieces did they had to be launched with a decent amount of velocity! After researching on line I discovered that there have been numerous incidents of this occurring; although at this point a recall has not been issued. The question of ""safety"" vs. ""quality"" appears to be the pending item. In my case although the ""Tempered"" glass did break into tiny pieces as it is designed to do... I am so thankful that my kids or any family member was at the desk. This is simply because although the glass broke into smaller peices... the smaller peices still contained very sharp ""shards"" of glass and glass flakes.  No one could predict the potential harm or danger a single small piece of glass launching into an eye would present. Again, it broke into relatively small pieces however I want to be clear.

The top is held in place by only gravity, resting on soft plastic pads glued to the metal chrome  plated frame and legs  i.e., the top was not latched to the frame.

This table functioned well for several years but last Monday (September 23, 2013)  it exploded  with considerable force and sound  sending small jagged bits of glass up to 12 feet from the center of the table.  There is no way to estimate the number of glass shards (mostly approximately  0.25 X0.25 rectangular bits) but there were hundreds of thousands (literally) of them. The covered the entire kitchen floor some were found on the dining room carpet over 12 feet from the original center of the table.  Most of these shards had extremely sharp jagged sides and edges.  They were extremely difficult to clean up safely.

As luck would have it I had just passed by the table as was standing within 6 ft of the table but was behind a kitchen island and did not get hit with glass  but I believe anyone in line of the glass trajectory would have been cut  perhaps seriously.  

I was not looking at the table at the time of explosion so I can not describe it other than to say it sounded like gun shot or a large fire cracker.

We attempted to call Ikea and report the problem and were immediately told that the table was ""out of warranty"" but that we could buy a new top from Ikea.  We have no interest in another such table top.

We persisted and insisted that we wanted to report it as a safety concern to Ikea -- at this point we routed for desk to desk (each time with a long hold times) after about 4 or 5 transfers the phone would go dead.  We redialed and the same thing happened -- a series of transfers then the phone disconnected.  But calls to Ikea lasted more than 20 minutes before the phone disconnected.  It seemed like a pattern and if you read the internet you find many making this same complaint.

Late last summer (2010... I could find the receipt with the exact date if you need it) I bought 1 Birch Veneer Malm 3 Drawer Chest and 1 Birch Veneer Malm 6 Drawer Dresser from IKEA at my local Ikea store in Charlotte. I also bought 2 Black Billy Bookcases. I bought the furniture to go in my 2nd house at the time... not my permanent residence. 

I only stayed the night at that location 5 times when I first bought the furniture, then I didn't stay there anymore for over a year. At that time I realized furniture initially had a strong smell... particularly the Malm, but I thought it would go away with time, but it didn't. When I would go to that residence to get belongings every once in a while I was surprised to know that my room still smelled strongly of fumes. I didn't think much about it since I was not spending much time there.

Move forward... in August of this year I moved out the furniture out of that residence and put it in storage. Then about two weeks ago moved the furniture into my bedroom at my new residence. IThe first thing I noticed was that the place where I had the furniture stored smelled like the strong fumes associated with the furniture, and then my new bedroom begin to smell like that as well once I moved the furniture in. I also began having some respiratory symptoms and a general feeling of malaise when spending any significant amount of time in the room. It is also making any of my clothes that I keep in the furniture smell like some sort of chemicals. When I slept in the same room as the furniture all the next day I felt extremely bad. 

I felt so sick I have decided that I don't think it's safe, or pleasant to keep the furniture in my room any longer. I am going to be moving it to storage until I hear back from you guys. 

I really like the way the furniture looks and functions, but obviously I can 't keep it around because of the fumes. It's really quiet unbelievable how strong they are. Anyone who has been in my room has noticed it, and once I let them smell the inside of the furniture drawers they can't believe it is so strong. 

 I think this may be a consumer safety issue Ikea may want to look into.

All the other play mats that I have purchased from other stores, the toys dangling down are raised.  the object of the play mat is to get the infant to raise their hands and play and touch the hanging toys.  

I immediately took the mat away and returned it to Ikea.  Went to the return department and told them of the incident and the man stated we have not had any other incidents.  It was a new item to the store, so how could their of been any.  I do not know if they still carry the play mat with toys hanging from soft cloth arches above, but would hate any one to gert injuried or cause death.

The reason purchased the play mat from Ikea is that it was so much more cute than the others.  

With all that being said, I went to return as stated and did  not want it, especially if I saw harm being done to an infant, due to defect.  The return cashier, asked for my receipt and I did not have it at the time, so believe it or not , could not get a refund for a very dangerous item and said I could get another one.  NO THANK  YOU!@!!!!  so I had to get a store credit.  It was only around 20.00 but it was the principle of the dangerous item and the defect of the playmat.

Now that I know this web site exsists, I will make sure I report all to help someone else.  And maybe, just maybe the companies will have to be accountable and listen to the consumer more.

Repeated tightening of the hinge eventually causes the hinge to break, spilling small bearings all over the floor.  I have twice written to IKEA corporate, asking that a replacement design be developed.  IKEA no longer sells this model, so they must have realized the folly of the original design.

You should have my Serial Number and such on file. It was installed by one of your authorized agents. I have had numerous problems with it even though I have had it meticulously maintained, and have needed it repaired numerous times over its short life so far.

I work at home and have had numerous bouts of headaches this winter, but the furnace seemed to be working properly.  When Rowell Service of Franklin NH came in to do a routine annual cleaning of the furnace last week, the serviceman said he smelled something as soon as he entered our basement, and then found that the exhaust tube exiting the furnace had a large hole corroded through it, allowing the furnace to push its exhaust gases directly into our home.That explains all of my headaches. He put a temporary patch over the hole and told me parts needed to by ordered to repair it. Relatedly, the acidic dripping from the hole into the furnace had caused the need for additional internal repairs. And that dripping turned out to be the cause of the leaking onto the basement floor which we though was leaking pipe fittings that a different plumber was unable to repair last Spring indicating that the problem was present but unnoticed since at least last winter.

Rowell called back the next day back to explain that the repairs with labor were going to exceed $1000. Having no other choice, I authorized them to order the parts. Rowell called today to say that when the parts came in, the vent adaptor was not included. So they did some research and found that this corrosion is an epidemic problem with this furnace and (as they heard though the grapevine) was the subject of a supposed recall. The first part of that turned out to be true but the second didnt it is clearly an epidemic problem, but amazingly is not the subject of a recall (yet).

Epidemic failure of vent adapter causes CO fumes to exhaust directly into living space.
My Buderus Model GB142 furnace is 4-5 years old  and was properly installed by an authorized Buderus Agent. Similar models to the GB-142 are 24/30/45/60. I recently scheduled a cleaning but the service person (not a Buderus Agent) found that the vent adapter was rotted away and that carbon-monoxide-rich exhaust was flowing directly into our basement (maybe explaining a recent surge in headaches). Further research finds that Buderus (a division of Bosch) is aware of the problem, has redesigned the failing component, and has issued an internal ""Product Notice"" (https://www.bosch-climate.us/files/PIN_GB142_Vent_Adaptor_Inspection_US.pdf). Yet they have not notified consumers and have apparently not reported the problem to the CPSC. They offered to replace the part for free (only if I had registered the warranty when I bought the furnace and follow the very complicated re-imbursement procedure) but I will still need to pay the several hundred dollars to have their authorized service agent install it. 
The photo in the Product Notice shows a failure that is identical to mine and the gaping hole depicted makes clear the danger of the problem... That hole is in the exhaust pipe and an internal blower is forcing the exhaust under and pressure through that hole and into our home!!!!

The wiring through my wall for the old one (which I also installed myself in the mid '80s) has only two wires (line and neutral). I decided to ignore the grounding warnings and connected the two wires to the screws on the machine that are plainly marked L and N. I noticed later that when I grabbed my stainless steel sink and touched the washer at the same time I was feeling a slight electric buzz so I decide that I should ground it just to be safe. I did not kill the breaker for this. I was surprised that when I touched the attached wire to ground there were sparks and I could be lightly shocked having skin between the ground and the end of the wire. Something's not right. After some consideration, I decided to switch the L and N wires so that they are connected to what should be the wrong screws as they are labeled. Now, even without the ground wire connected, there is no shock between the sink and machine, and there is also no sparking or juice at the ground when I do connect it. My point is that if a responsible person made all these connections with the power off before turning it on, he or she would not know that there was a constant feed of electricity flowing to ground which is a short but not enough to trip a breaker.

The plug to the dishwasher was literally melted into the electrical outlet and it took two men to remove it. If I had not been home and smelled smoke I am certain the fire would not have been contained to the dishwasher and wiring.    I thought the house wiring caused the fire since the dishwasher was only two years old. It was out of warranty so I knew Bosch would tell me sorry, it's too late.  If I had known the dishwasher caused the fire I certainly would have contacted Bosch.   I smelled smoke once before the actual fire that destroyed the machine and saw smoke coming from the dishwasher.  I turned the dishwasher off and called a repairman.   He could find nothing wrong with the dishwasher and acted like it was only steam coming from the machine and not smoke. I read about the recall making me realize that it was not my home wiring at fault. I called and spoke with a Bosch rep and she had the gall to tell me that my machine was not one of the ones affected!  If so, then why did the plug catch fire and burn up the dishwasher and home wiring?  The dishwasher was hauled off when I replaced it with another brand.  I did not find out until I received the January, 2018 issue of Consumer Reports that Bosch dishwashers were being recalled due to the exact problem I experienced.

Starting in August, 2017, the dishwasher has continued to trip the circuit breaker whenever I use it.  I stopped using the appliance. Had a repairman check the unit, but he did not find a problem.  Replaced the circuit breaker on 12/2/2017.
 
Started the appliance 12/6/2017 and it ran for about 10 minutes, before the circuit breaker tripped again. Reset breaker and started the appliance on 12/7/2017.  Appliance ran for 10 minutes and then tripped the breaker.

Checked the power cord from its exit from the module, to its connection to the dishwasher, to see if it was warm, but it felt normal.  However the junction box was quite hot to the touch. Is this related to the overheating power cord?

I traced the odor to the dishwasher, which was still running. I stopped the cycle by opening the dishwasher door. The smell was not very strong inside the dishwasher but outside of it toward the floor. By that time my head was pounding and the smoke smell had increased. I opened windows for fresh air, and waited next to the dishwasher with a fire extinguisher. The smell gradually dissipated but not completely until the next day. Several hours later, my husband pulled the machine from the cavity and removed the lower panel.

No.  Caller doesn't want to argue with a company that judging from previous recalls that did not fix the problem, is not consumer friendly.  The dishwasher, halfway through its cycle, released the most foul, toxic smell, like burning rubber or chemicals.  Caller left the kitchen area after opening windows and doors. She went online and found scores of complaints from alarmed consumers.  They all had similar experiences:  strong chemical odors.  Sending their kids out of the kitchen.  One man said the smell was driving him nuts.  He bought a brand new, high end product, and the company suggested he pour vinegar in the dishwasher each time he used it.  One woman shared how a Sears Salesman suggested she buy the most expensive model and maybe the smell would go away over time.  All consumer did was google Bosh and sticky smell.

Perhaps you can find out:  what exactly is Bitumen?  Caller read online that it is a chemical that is related to the chemical in asphalt.  She knows nothing about tar and asphalt, but she is hopeful you do.

Caller wishes she kept her old stainless steel dishwasher.  It was noisy, but never had any problems.  Apparently there are no Bitumen-free dishwashers being manufactured.  Besides being noxious, is Bitumen carcinogenic?  She hopes to hear back from you, if possible because I won't stop until I have the answers.  You have consumers out there who are being sold products that have no business being on the market.  As one  man posted, with humor ""I'd rather have a noisy dishwasher than one that is trying to kill me.""  Is bitumen what is used to make these dishwashers so silent?  And what is 'outgassing'?  Are these fumes toxic as well as noxious?  Caller took one whiff and it made her want to throw up.

Looked in the cabinet adjacent to it to try and locate the source. Located Bosch Junction box for the dishwasher. That is where the smell was coming from. The wires going into the box were black from heat and had soot on them. Called Bosch. They told us to call Service Care and they would pay for the diagnostic charge. Service care came out and opened the box. It was badly burned inside. Could have caught our house on fire. Service care said it would be an additional 251.00 to repair and Bosch would not pay it that we would have to. Sent email to Bosch with a picture of the box. Bosch said it was due to a faulty installation. Called Sears where we bought the unit and paid for them to install it. They sent the installer out who had done the installation.
He said the following in writing:
Upon inspection I found a burnt connection where the common wire connects inside the junction box. When I removed the wires on the factory installed side of the box the metal connector block for the hot wire was loose and slid out of the plastic block. When I disconnected the wires from the house side they were all tight. There was obviously a breach of the plastic between the hot and common wire inside the block where the connection was made. this could only be a fault of the factory or parts from the factory. The photos taken show the faulty connection between the hot and common connection block that happened over a period of time. A hole was burned between the hot and common wire in the plastic wall inside the connection block. It was the result of the metal block that connects the hot wire not being secure in the plastic block.

I sent this information to Bosch as well. To date I have not received a response from them. My wife called them on August 9th. They said it was a faulty installation by the installation person.

I had turned my dishwasher on a few minutes earlier and thought maybe something dropped to the bottom and was burning.  I opened the door of my three-year-old Bosch dishwasher and checked around and saw that nothing was on the bottom.  I closed the door and heard a pop and smoke began billowing out of my dishwasher! All of the controls on the door had gone black, too. I got my fire extinguisher out just in case and checked around the sides to make sure I didnt see flames.  Smoke was pouring out from underneath my sink as well so I was really concerned about a fire.  After about 20 minutes, the smoke dissipated and I felt safe again.   Monday, I called Prestige Appliance, where I purchased the dishwasher, and set up a service call for April 27. When the repairman pulled the dishwasher out, the right back side was black with soot, as was the wall behind it. At this point, I expected that they would offer to replace the appliance, but he said they were only authorized to repair. I politely told him that I expect nothing less than a replacement.  He called Bosch and started a file to reference the situation and told me that Bosch would contact me in the next few days.  Before he left, I asked him if I had done anything wrong to cause the appliance to literally burn up? He assured me it was nothing I had done, and that there had been a recall a few years prior due to a short electrical cord. I asked him if this was the case with my dishwasher and he assured me that there was plenty of cord on mine. 

On Tuesday, May 2, I had still not heard from Bosch or Prestige Appliance, so I called both, getting the run-around about how Prestige sent the information but Bosch didnt have it. Meanwhile, today is May 4th and I called Bosch customer service and was told that they are still reviewing the situation and that they should get back to me within the next few days. (more placating)  

I am very concerned that Bosch does not want to take my dishwasher and inspect it to find out why it nearly caught on fire. I believe that this situation is very serious and there could be others that may be at risk due to a defect in this product. I decided that it was important to report it to you since it seems that Bosch isn't taking it seriously.",Lexington,South Carolina,29072,Home/Apartment/Condominium,"Incident, No Injury",Female,Self,55,Yes,No,,,No,Yes,,I explain the contact in my incident report,"(10/31/2017) BSH HOME APPLIANCES CORPORATION: The dishwasher in this report is one that was recalled on October 20, 2017 in Cooperation with the CPSC (18-013 ).

The unit was subject to a recall for the power cord, and Bosch previously sent a technician (from Mr. Appliance, Epping NH, [REDACTED]) out to replace the cord set (on 8 December 2015). The technician applied a green ""R"" sticker on the top edge of the door and on the cover of the junction box.

This morning (5 May 2017) it was noticed that dishes were wet, and the unit had not fully drained from a cycle started last night. It was then noticed that the unit would not turn on. This evening, I pulled the unit out from under the counter, unplugged the power cord from the unit, and checked for voltage. There was 123V from the hot to ground, but only 3V from the hot to neutral. I turned off the circuit breaker, and opened the power cord junction box. The terminal in the power cord junction box (which the Bosch-authorized Mr Appliance technician had previously worked on) had clear evidence of overheating.

On 10/3/2016, the junction box and power supply that came packaged with the unit caught on fire and melted the box. Subsequently, the electrical fire and smoke damaged my kitchen cabinets.

Luckily, I was home and smelled the burning plastic so the damage was relatively minimal. However, had I not been home, the fire could have been catastrophic.

I had a licensed electrician troubleshoot and repair the problem. He said there was a problem with the junction box and that a plastic junction box and power supply should have never been used. To correct the safety issue, he replaced the melted junction box with a metal one.

I contact Bosch about the problem and they dismissed it as an installation issue without providing any other information or reasoning.

Two weeks ago it started working erratically and then stopped working altogether.  So my wife called Bosch customer service and made an appointment for a service call.

When the service technician arrived, she ran her checks and in the process determined that power was not getting to the machine. This particular dishwasher uses an unconventional line connection.  Instead of a 115 ac three prong plug or a UL approved standard junction box with hard-wired wire nut connectors, Bosh provides a plastic junction box with a proprietary pigtail to the dishwasher and a terminal board with screw terminals to connect the ac supply line. 

When the technician opened the junction box, it was readily apparent that the terminal board between the pigtail and the ac line had failed.  She could not immediately replace it because she did not have one in stock.  She commented that This junction box had been the subject of a recall by Bosch, and that We carry them on the truck because we replace a lot of them.  She also told us how to contact Bosch to make a claim for a replacement unit but that she wasn't sure the recall applied to our model machine.

When my wife called Bosch as instructed to by the technician, she was told that the recall did not apply to the model machine we own, that the machine is out of warranty and that the failure is due to a faulty installation not a defect in the design of the junction box.  When my wife tried to speak with a manager, the customer service representative became  very evasive and refused to provide a last name and contact information for a manager.  She was told that Bosch would contact her the following day.  Bosch has yet to respond to her request to speak to a manager.

I am both an electrical engineer and an amateur radio operator.  I have supervised electronics technicians for over 17 years.  I assure you that there was nothing wrong with the installation.  In fact the technician complimented the anonymous installer on a job well done.  I am certain that the terminals were torqued to a reasonable degree and that the wires were not loose and not likely to loosen to the point where an arc would happen.

I am writing to you to report that Bosch has NOT corrected the problem.  As you can see from the enclosed photo, this is a serious problem which could have resulted in a serious fire in our house.  It did not cause the breaker to trip but the charred insulation and terminal board was hot enough to cause a fire to ignite.  The evasiveness of the Bosch Customer Service Representative and the refusal to have management contact us implies strongly that Bosch is trying to cover up a serious product safety issue.  I make this report to disclose this dangerous design weakness in the interest of those who have bought this machine and are unaware of the potential disaster that is lurking under their kitchen counters.

  *  It smells any time there is even one or two dishes in the dishwasher (We even rinse them off before we put them in).  Not just a little smell, it will stink up the entire house.  After calling Bosch, they suggested using a cleaner (we did) and not leaving dirty dishes in the dishwasher (really?!) I actually spray bleach in the dishwasher between cycles (we run the dishwasher 2-3 times per week) to help with the smell, although it doesn't really help much.

  *  Our biggest health concern:  Mildew/mold grows inside.  We left town for a few days.  We we came back and opened the door, there were strings of gray mildew/mold growing from the top spinner.  There were only a couple of rinsed cups in the top rack.  This cannot be safe.  

My opinion is that because this dishwasher does not have a dry cycle, the inside is always wet and warm contributing to the smell and mildew/mold issue.  I may be wrong of course but something not right is going on.  This should not be happening.

It's Model Number NGM5664UC/03.  Serial Number 920900017.  The layout of the cooktop has five burners -- two on each side, and one in the middle rear.  The control panel metal plate with knbos is in the middle front of the cooktop.

I began noticing that the control panel metal plate grew very hot when the cooktop was in use.  It gets so hot that if my hand accidentally touches the plate for more than a few seconds, the skin would be burned.  I called Bosch to complain about this in March 2016.  They sent out a technician on March 29, who told me that the cooktop has a known knob/range defect of conducting heat to the control panel.  He ordered some foam to put underneath the metal cooktop frame, and returned in May to apply it.  However, the foam did nothing, so I called Bosch to complain again.

Their technician returned on May 17, wrote up a report and said nothing could be done to fix it.  After several frustrating calls to Bosch, I got no help.  So on June 2, I filed a complaint with the Los Angeles County Department of Consumer and Business Affairs.  The investigator looked into the issue, and Bosch agreed to send out a third-party vendor ([REDACTED]) for a second opinion.

The [REDACTED] technician came out July 8.  He measured the temperature of the control panel when the burner was on a medium flame at 128 degrees.  He said if I had turned the flame up to its maximum, the temperature would have gone even higher, but there was nothing he could do to fix the problem.  Bosch considered the matter closed, and offered me a little more than $500 to buy back the cooktop.  I declined their offer.

In May 2016, while the oven is turned OFF, the broiler came on by itself. The oven alerted (beep sounds) me, and when I touched the oven handle and panel, it was VERY VERY hot. I immediately turned the power breaker off to cut off any power to the oven. I left the oven OFF and immediately called BOSCH. BOSCH stated they would have an authorized dealer diagnose the issue. Initial dealer that investigated the issue stated it was the ""communications board"". He had asked me to turn the oven on to help him diagnose. He said I could use the oven, but ""be careful"". A few days later, more burning smell from the oven (I called the fire department) and cut off the power to the oven again. Fire department did not identify the cause of the smell. The initial dealer never returned to complete the repair. I called in a 2nd dealer. When he investigated the oven, he found multiple components had burned down within the appliance, including the board and wires. 

This is a very dangerous situation where the oven is catching fire while in the OFF position. If the fire was not contained within the oven, it would have easily spread in the kitchen. My oven sits next to a gas cooktop - making the situation even more volatile.

Bosch blamed this as an installation error and wants to charge me for repairs.  I do not agree and am continuing to escalate with them.

Upon close inspection of the junction box, the root cause of the problem appears to be a design flaw which allows the supply wire to be slipped into its receptacle *outside* the clamp that is supposed to hold it.   (The clamp is a tiny piece of metal in the receptacle which moves when a screw is tightened.)   Therefore an installer would tighten the screw and get the impression that the supply cable is being held in place firmly, when in fact it remains loose.  The loose contact then causes the wire to overheat, causing a fire.

Gradually, we began having difficulty to turning the gas on or off. On a couple of occasions only the smell of gas alerted us that despite the knob pointing to the off mark, in fact had not completely shut the gas off. We then realized that ALL of the knobs were cracked (see attached pictures), we went to ABT Electronics and express our safety concerns about the low quality and fragility of cooktop knobs we had bought from this store. They did not show any concern about selling a product with that high risk safety issue; the only response was to sell us the replacements for $18.00, dollars plus tax a piece, totaling over $115.00.
Failing to get our safety concerns through with ABT Electronics, we went directly to Bosch and Siemens Corporation, 1901 Main Street, Suite-600, Irvine, CA 92614, (949)440-7100. We contacted this company by telephone and spoke to Ms. [REDACTED] Customer Service, explaining in detail the potential for gas leaks, fire, explosion and Carbon Monoxide poisoning resulting from the defective cooktop knobs. She did not express any interest or concern and like ABT Electronics, only offer to sell to us the same frail, Inadequate and unsafe cooktop knobs, but with 10% discount. I strongly made clear to her that my fear was the unsafe design and poor quality of the material of the knobs, not a handout.

I will attach it to your file.'' To this date I have not heard anything from Bosch and Siemens Corporation.

the water heater. As such, it has flash frozen four times since it was installed (freezes very quickly). The latest

and steam. Luckily for us, we were home at the time and heard the commotion in our basement. Otherwise, the
heater would have continued to pour water on the floor and run continuously.

I called Bosch before this incident to inquire about a backdraft preventer. They do not offer such a product for this
water heater and do not seem very concerned about the potential for problems. The service people suggested that
we contact an HVAC person to see if they could balance the house. As I mentioned, we had the previous tankless
water heater for years without incident. It would occasionally blow out the pilot light from down drafts. But, the
downdrafts were not a persistent problem and likely resulted from a rapid change in barometric pressure that
causes an imbalance between the outside and inside air. We were convinced that an HVAC person would not be

One night we started a load of dishes. We noticed a few hours later that the dishwasher seemed stuck on ""1 minute"" and would not complete its cycle. The dishes did not seem to be washed, and the interior was cool -- not normal for a Bosch! We found out from a repair person that the heater relay on the control board of our dishwasher failed. He said that Bosch has the name and reputation as the best, but that they use inferior small parts that fail so that they get some more money from you for those expensive small parts. If you build a dishwasher to last, how will you make any more money off the consumer? Repair estimate: $265. Dishwasher cost: $550. 

After looking online, we saw that there was a recall of dishwashers made during the time ours was. Ours is a SHU33A02Uc/40, though apparently our model's serial number does not fall into the recall category. I believe it should. What happened to us should not have happened.

When it stopped working again we found the user manual and took the face off to see if we could figure out what part needed to be fixed/replaced. Upon opening the machine a metal box in the bottom right corner was visibly singed. We took the box off and it revealed electrical wiring. The wires were also singed. Upon moving the wires (only slightly) the wires sparked and caught fire. Thankfully we keep a fire extinguisher in the kitchen and were able to extinguish the fire (creating quite a mess). We have turned the breaker that runs to the dishwasher off until we can get it removed or replaced, but this is a terrifying incident. Our regular habit was to run the dishwasher at night immediately before bed. We have a five month old baby. I am so disturbed to think what could have happened to our family had our kitchen caught fire while we were upstairs in bed for the night. Also the wires sparked with very little touch. This means had our dogs or someone knocked the machine it very well may have started a fire, and would have surely been harder to extinguish with all the other metal surrounding it making it hard to pinpoint the exact location of the blaze.

Yet the electrical component is rated for only 10 amps.  The consumer says over time if you over stress a component, the heat will effect the weakest part of the circuit which is the connection between the component and the board.  

That allows less electricity to flow which will make the unit much hotter. The consumer says that he believes this is a serious fire hazard.  The consumer says he contacted the manufacturer who said this unit is not part of the recall and they offered no assistance.

There is a ""voluntary"" recall on SHE46C02, as models Bosch / SHE46C, SHE56C / FD8501 - FD8505.

My dishwasher is a Bosch SHE46C02UC/40 FD8610 00093, and is not part of the ""voluntary"" recall, so it will not be repaired as defective by Bosch.  
Based on quick review of internet searches, MANY or MOST of the SHE436C models appear defective, the defect being a burned control board. By being physically burned (electrically shorting out),  this dishwasher SERIES is a FIRE HAZARD. Although Bosch replaces boards for ""voluntary"" recall models, and the internet has people soldering the boards for temporary repair, neither of these ""fixes"" will repair the defect of the circuit design which is causing an electronic fault which continues to result in a FIRE HAZARD. 

The diswasher is useless without a working control board and cannot run without a control board. Running the dishwasher with a defective board is running the dishwasher with a FIRE HAZARD. 

Bosch refuses to fix and repair this KNOWN FIRE HAZARD model. Their ""voluntary"" recall was performed to limit the scope of recalls on the entire defective series. The entire series of dishwashers using these defective fire hazard boards should be recalled. The recall should be MANDATORY, not ""voluntary"". 

It is unknown if the repair of the defective and recalled Bosch models eliminates the known fire hazard. 

The board is expensive for consumers to replace, $150 USD or more just for the part.  Replacing a burned burned with the same burned results in a CONTINUING 
FIRE HAZARD. 

The Consumer Product Safety Commision is negligent in allowing a ""voluntary"" recall, when in fact, the defect and its proposed solution needed further evaluation and review. The CPSC will not act without further consumer complaints, but the CPSC website tries hard to hide where consumer complaints can even be submitted. I believe the recall should be MANDATORY.

Then the fire leaped out of the door again and I fired several more bursts. Finally the flames died. My wife had called 911 while I was fighting the fire. When the firemen arrived, they removed the dishwasher and put it in our driveway. Melting plastic from the front door had fallen on the linoleum floor of the kitchen and burned it.

She turned away and went to the sink which is about 3.5 feet. She was at the sink for about 1.5 seconds and the cooktop shattered (blew-up). The glass was tempered and about 99% stayed intact. Pieces of the remaining 1% of the glass was found up to 22 feet away from the cooktop. My wife got hit with some of the glass (some pieces were found in her hair), but she was not injured and no medical attention was needed. My daughter was in the family room, the most distant area where glass was found, she was not hit with any flying glass. I received a cut on the bottom of my foot from a piece of glass ( during the clean up stage). My wife removed it and no other medical attention was needed. I called Bosch on 12/03/12 (Monday) to report the incident. If my wife happened to be in front of the cooktop she very well would have incurred some serious injuries or possibly been fatally injured.
The Bosch cooktop was purchased in 10/23/99 and was installed sometime in December 1999 during the the final phase of construction. I have had many issues with this product and have work orders from 2004,2005,2006,2009,2011. The last three occasions were installation of an enhancement kit: NHT72# AUC Field Kit, 820119.

This device has given me pause about my very long time admiration of German engineering~ (GeI1nan cars from 1961 to and including the present.) This is now the second episode of outages. My prior, American made model always worked during its long lifetime. I find myself grieving over its death and its subsequent replacement with your Bosch.
In addition to not being able to read the serial number, which is inside the cover behind piping, etc., one cannot access the restart button without opening the protective cover. When the cover is opened, the inner wiring and piping are exposed, and they surround the  restart button, and that is how I received a strong electric shock yesterday, attempting to push the restart button.
The danger of your heater has thus been dramatically demonstrated to me. While I hesitate to give someone of your status and expertise advice, it seems obvious, that to protect consumers, both the serial number and the restart button should be placed in a safe and easily accessible location.
Since I have wisely switched from trying to push the reset button with my finger, ever hopeful, trying to get it to restart, using instead the wooden handle of a spatula in a move toward self-preservation, I have concluded that the restart button seems not to push. It does not restart. The red light comes on only when the heater is working and the water is flowing hot. That may be correct functioning. My instruction book is with the plumber at the moment as he was testing the unit in his stop, at which point it was working. At that time, he also contacted your customer service representative who, I was advised was not helpful. How could he have been? The unit was then, diabolically, working, and we had not yet realized that the problem was intermittent. It was guessed that the problem was that we had changed the water pressure. We had not. Your representative did complain, however, that we had not mailed in the registration, which we subsequently did, however, without the inaccessible serial number.
It is my opinion that there is something wrong with the electrical function of the Powerstream Pro. (We have checked circuit breakers, etc., and all is well with the building's electrical system.) It is expensive to get a plumber or an electrician to come out, especially for an intermittent problem. Who knows when to make the request for service? The plumber was scheduled to come today, but this morning the unit is working, at least when I was last in the kitchen, so I must quickly and hopefully get some dishes done.
Therefore, I am asking that you either replace my unit with a safe, dependable, functioning one, and pay for the plumber to uninstall the existing one, and install the replacement. Otherwise, I would like a refund of what has been invested in the existing heater including purchase, and installation, and service, $978.00, receipts enclosed.

The range trim plastic piece which holds the glass onto the oven front broke - we had Sears come out to fix it and they said it was loose and screwed it back on.

Subject:	Bosch gas stove, Model No. HG55L50UC06; Model 9109 000051
		Rack design defect: potential fire or injury hazard

Late last year, we acquired and had installed the Bosch stove unit.  Twice despite being careful in using the oven, an accident has occurred.

To wit, twice I have placed a pan on the oven rack and after a few minutes of baking I needed to add another pan to the same rack.  Per Boschs instructions:  In doing so, I pulled the rack forward, placed the new (2nd) pan on the rack, pushing the first pan back a bit.  Perhaps I pushed a bit too firmly or too far, but the first pan tumbled onto the rack or oven pan below.

Regardless, anyone could inadvertently cause a pan to fall beyond the back of the extended rack.  Fortuitously, in these cases there were no cooking oils or fats extracted from the baking process that could have spilled through the opening in the oven bottom to the flames below the oven bottom.  

Unfortunately, the lip on the racks back side is minimal at most.   Likewise there is an absence of a meaningful curl or turn-up to the racks back side.  It would appear that a one-time modest cost saving in design effort and assembly jig construction, can now give rise to devastating and preventable accident.

Per diagram in the user manual and in execution there is virtually no lip or curl and whatever has been designed and manufactured is minimal to be charitable.
 
Kindly advise when an improved and safer rack is available to overcome this dangerous hazard.

To wit, twice I have placed a pan on the oven rack and after a few minutes of baking I needed to add another pan to the same rack.  Per Boschs instructions:  In doing so, I pulled the rack forward, placed the new (2nd) pan on the rack, pushing the first pan back a bit.  Perhaps I pushed a bit too firmly or too far, but the first pan tumbled onto the rack or oven pan below.

Unfortunately, the lip on the racks back side is minimal at most.   Likewise there is an absence of a meaningful curl or turn-up to the racks back side.

The technician stated that the power cord supplied by Sears for Bosch dishwashers was unsafe, and needed to be replaced by a 14 gauge cord at an additional cost of $45 to me.

He provided a copy of an Email to Sears service providers that discussed the problem, although not the extra $45 charge.  I photocopied and then scanned the letter, which I can provide.

I asked for Sears to confirm in writing that the replacement 14 gauge power cord is safe, and to refund the above charge, and have not yet received a reply.

I asked the lead technician if they had gone back to replace the power cords that they installed before the safety issue was identified, and he said that Sears had not issued a recall and that they had not replaced any cords.

I checked out the report by CBS2 and I see others have replaced the control panel in lieu of the dishwasher (the companies, that is).
I called Bosch. They said their dishwashers ""run hot"" and that is normal.
Then when I said I plan to follow up, Bosch said, ""oh, we cant tell you if yours is fine. You have to determine that"" (paraphrasing). I did determine that!

I have owned a Bosch model 4410L compound miter saw for about four years in addition to other woodworking tools manufactured by Bosch.

I found what I believe is a safety flaw in the miter saw.

I performed my first bevel operation and ran the blade into the sliding fence destroying both.

I have been making miter cuts for years without sliding the fences out without incident thereby I never gave it a thought to pull these sliders out for the bevel cut.

The shrapnel is what I feel might cause an injury to some one else that owns this or similar product.

The shrapnel hit the steel garage door denting it and ricocheted and hit the back garage wall where the large piece of the fence came to rest.

There was an awful amount of energy needing to be dispersed by this shrapnel and if an individual were in the path of this shrapnel a severe if not fatal injury would have occurred - my opinion.

Additionally, I feel that the safety labeling could be improved to help ""idiot proof"" this function and would like to share my opinion as an end user.

One of which shows what I believe would be a perfect place for a ""fence"" warning that could be integral to this existing mechanically fastened protractor scale - no adhesive to fail.

Every time that the bevel function is utilized one has to affix their view on this protractor to gauge the angle that is trying to be acquired thereby viewing the included fence warning.

I shared these photos and my experience with other engineers in my department and they concur that at the very least the labeling must be improved.

The safety labeling on my unit has a defect with the adhesive - that is failing also.

I have photos to share which are attached showing the damage that occurred including the failing adhesive on the labeling but this form does not offer any method that I can see to do so.

No injury has occurred just damage to the unit and my garage door.

I have worked in mechanical engineering my whole career and have been involved with safety labeling projects for dangerous equipment.

It is/was my fault but engineering must do their best to ""idiot proof"" (yes, I'm the idiot) their products and safety label as best they can.

I am not seeking compensation but it is my duty to inform others of a potentially dangerous condition.

Best Regards.

We reviewed the manual with him and indicated where in the manual he could find information regarding moving the fence when making compound cuts (miter bevel cuts).  Together we reviewed the specific reference on page 28 of his manual and the tool's warning label to move the fence and make a Dry-run before turning the saw on.  He agreed that we provide warnings and instructions on the product and in the manual on this cutting application.  
As a goodwill gesture, we replaced the fence, damaged due to his action, as well as a new saw blade.

My prior experience with Bosch has been with automotive products where they have consistently performed at a high level. Unfortunately that expectation of the same quality is present in your Home Appliance line has not been met.
When I reported black mold forming on the washer door seal your customer service department stated I should ""wipe down and dry the rubber seal"" after each use. For a product that operates in a wet environment this does not feel like a reasonable request. I even escalated in an executive response area, and person confirmed the washer needs to be wiped dry after each use. I expect adequate drainage and drying capability to address the moisture in a washer. I think the product, as designed, is not functional and also creates a health hazard.
Doing some research (googled ""Bosch washer mold"") I found this to be a common complaint about your front load washer products. I am surprised no action has been taken to correct this defect as it poses a health risk to consumers in my opinion. In addition to eliminating any Bosch Home Appliances from future consideration you are also damaging the Bosch brand with shoddy products and poor customer service.
I am your target customer and so are my friends. By not acknowledging and addressing this issue you are destroying Bosch's ""high quality technology"" reputation and alienating customers.

Though we sent our registration card in, we were never notified by Bosch.  The dishwasher caught fire last week, and though all the wiring and control panel is blackened by the smoke and fire, Bosch wants to replace the board.  The authorized repair service says they cannot get the part for at least 3 weeks as well.  I'm furious.  I normally start the dishwasher and go to bed, or start the dishwasher and leave the house.  Luckily this time I was home.  I walked outside after starting the dishwasher and returned 10 minutes later to find my kitchen filled with smoke, so much smoke that the glasses in my upper cupboards had to be re- washed.  The smoke was coming from the dishwasher which was making a horrible popping and crackling noise.  Not thinking I opened the dishwasher to turn it off and burned (not badly) my hand in the process.  

So, first I want to report it, tho we were very lucky our home was not damaged.  Second, I want to complain about Bosch not handling this correctly.  They said I can have 200 dollars credit towards a new Bosch dishwasher or they can repair it.  The dishwasher was $800 and it's only 7 years old.  It should have lasted 20 years.  At the very least they should pro-rate the reimbursement.  I also strongly believe that a dishwasher that caught fire should not be repaired.  One quick search on the Internet will show you that, after repair, they are catching fire again.

The issue that has driven me to complain to the CPSC is the terrible smell offgasing from the range when in use or during a self-clean that I now know is probably formaldehyde.  Given the symptoms it has cause me, I believe the range is offgasing formaldehyde a much higher rates than ""typical"" for ranges or that is ""expected"" by the company.  I have complained to Bosch without relief.  I am afarid to use my stove and believe this particular range has unacceptabley higher levels of formaldehyde offgassing -- for some reason when this particular stove was manufactured, it was given too much/not enough of something.  

Range:

Every time I used the range, I smelled a burnt plastic/chemical smell that permeated the whole house.  It stunk!!  

I then contacted Bosch and complained.  They told me to set up a warranty service repair.  I contacted Solar for an appointment and included my issues with the [REDACTED] in the same service call.  

The Solar technician stuck his head inside the range and said he did not smell anything.  Then he told me I had to run a self clean and set it for a 3 hour self clean.  He then left.  He said he was eager to get home.  

About an hour into the self clean that same evening my throat and eyes started to burn, it bacame harder to breathe and the same burnt plastic/chemical smell permeated the whole house.  I could not go anywhere and not smell it.  It smelled upstairs, downstairseverywhere.  I opened every window downstairs and even the back doors.  It did not eliminate the smell.  I put on the microwave vent fan.  The smell just kept getting worse and worse.  My six month old daughter started to cry and become irritable.  I can only assume it burned her eyes too.  I had to flee my house and stay with my mother for the night.  When I returned the next morning, the smell was still there everywhere.  I quickly got myself and my daughter dressed and left for work.  It took 3 days for the smell to go away.  When I opened the oven, there was very fine white dust like particles on the inside, so I wiped the inside of the oven down and cleaned it up. Then I turned on the convention bake fan and opened the door.  White particles were flying about in the oven.  I cleaned the oven again.  Again, with the convention fan on, I opened the oven and white particles were flying around.  I was not going to use this oven and put food in it with white particles flying around landing on my food.  I could take no more with this stove, so I left it for a week and would come back to clean it again and see if that would help.  I have cleaned and cleaned that oven and still there is fine white dust like particles circulating inside the oven.

About a week later, I was going to make some rice believing the stove top was o.k.  I had used it previously for making fudge for Christmas and other stovetop foods since I had it installed without issue.  I started the gas burner on the stove top, and all seemed fine until about 15 minutes into the 50 minute boil, I heard loud popping sounds.  I went into the kitchen and heard loud popping sounds and the blue flame would surge and turn yellow.  I tried another burner on, but that one did the same thing, about 5 minutes later.  This pop was so forcefully, it moved the cap off of the burner so that it would not re-light until I repositioned it.  I turned on another burner and it too popped.  The popping continued for a bit after the gas was turned off.  Alarmed, I turned off the gas.  I went to bed hungry that night afraid to use my stove for fear of a gas leak or fire.  I am extremely unhappy with this appliances performance also and believe the stove is a health and fire hazard.

Dear Bosch:

I received a letter from you requesting photographs and an insurance report on the incident that I reported to you via the telephone.  You obviously are not listening.  I can only assume you need a written account of the problems with the appliances.  Attached please find my original letter I sent to you detailing the trouble I have been having with my Bosch [REDACTED] and duel fuel range.  I will again recount the problems with additional information added.  

Background:

I purchases 3 Bosch appliances from Campo in Metairie, Louisiana, a duel fuel slide-in range, [REDACTED] and a microwave with delivery on 9/24/2010.  See attached receipt.  I began experiencing problems immediately.

Second Warranty Visit

I had a service appointment with Bonneval since I do not believe Solar was at all helpful, knowledgeable and was more concerned with getting home than diagnosing my problems.  However, I had to wait a week for Bonneval to come out.  Because of this complaint, Bosch advised me on the telephone not to use my stove until the repair person came out.  So, I was without a brand new expensive stove for a week and cant use my [REDACTED] as intended, or trust my dishes will come clean.

The day Bonneval was suppose to come out, no one came to my house, I received no phone call to confirm or cancel.  No one showed up.  This made me very angry.  I received a phone call the next day from someone at Bonneval saying that his technician finished at the previous job at 10:00 p.m. at night (which I do not believe) and thought it was too late to call.  Why is it that at 6:00 p.m. the technician/office could not have called me and said he got hung up on another call???????  This is just poor customer service.  The person from Bonneval that called agreed to schedule the service visit for 12:00 noon on Saturday.  So, I had to wait 5 more days without my range per Boschs instructions.  

When I got home on Saturday, I waited for the repair person.  12:00 came and went.  12:15 came and went; 12:30 came and went.  At 12:30, believing I was being stood up again, I contacted the diaper delivery service and told them to come over to show me how to use the larger diapers.  Shortly after I got off of the phone with the diaper service, Bonneval calls at 12:45.  I explained to the technician that I thought they were coming for 12:00, and that I had just asked someone to come over to demonstrate the new diapers I was getting.  The Bonneval technician said the ticket said anytime after 12:00 noon.  I said I agreed to 12:00 noon.  I told him that he could come now, but would have to wait until I was finished with the diaper service.  I told him twice he would have to wait.  

I then turned on my stove to try to get it to heat up so the technician could smell the chemical/burned plastic smell I smelled.  

The diaper service showed up. I told her I was having a repair person come and that we may be interrupted momentarily.  I asked her to smell inside the oven, and she said it smelled like burned plastic.  About 10 minutes later Bonneval showed up.

I let the repair persons in and then went upstairs to deal with the diaper service.  After I was finished, I turned my attention to the repair persons.  I was not present when they did their diagnosis.  Who knows what they did, if anything.  Basically, the repair technician said he could find nothing wrong with the range.  He said he tested my gas pressure and it was fine.  I noticed the oven was off.  I asked him about the stove smell.   He said it smelled normal to him, that these stoves have a baked on covering that needs to come off and that he recommends that customers open all of their windows and doors when they do a self clean.  I said it was not a normal smell and that is stunk up the whole house.  He replied that it was not stinking up the whole house now.  I said, of course not, you turned the stove off, and that I did not believe the smell was normal.  I then asked why the other repair person didnt warn me of the smell and to open windows if this was all normal.  He said he did not know.  I asked about the popping gas burners.  He said that the stove has a gas regulator that should prevent that.  I said well, it did not.  He seemed agitated at this point.  He said he was not finished.  I said go on.  He then said that my house was old, and that when another appliance came on, that could drop the pressure in the gas line and cause the popping.  I said had never heard of such a thing.  He then said he had had enough and stormed out of my house.  At no time did the repair person try to slide the stove out and check out the back of the stove to see if some sort of packing was still there or if something was making that smell.  Did he check the gas regulators in the stove to make sure they are functioning properly?  I do not know. 

What kind of customer service are you providing here?  Your repair persons are rude, condescending and tell customers a line of lies.

A very good friend of mine bought a Bosch electric range and [REDACTED] not long before I bought mine (months before I bought mine).  He recommended I buy Bosch because he liked his so much, and on his glowing recommendation, I bought Bosch.  My friend came to my house and smelled my oven.   He said his did not smell like that and that mine did indeed stink.  I went to my friends house, he turned on his oven, and I stuck my head in the oven.  It did not stink.  He said he has NEVER done a self clean to his oven and his range DOES NOT STINK like mine.  He also said his [REDACTED] cleans well.  Additionally, at his second home, he said his 2nd home is older than my home and his gas burners on a different model range ([REDACTED]perhaps I should have bought one of those!) have never popped.  My previous gas range burners that I had in the same house NEVER POPPED, and that gas stove was over 10 years old.  My friends Bosch electric oven (my oven is electric since it is a duel fuel) does not smell and no electric oven Ive ever owned smelled like this. This repair person was telling me a bunch of lies.  

Other customers ranges do not stink and their burners do not pop.  Their [REDACTED] perform well.  Both my [REDACTED] and stove continue to have performance issues and do not work as intended.  This to me is the definitive proof that the appliances are defective.  I do not dare risk turning on my stove again and have that smell or a fire.  My 7 month old daughter is too precious to risk that.  AGAIN, I am requesting that you take the stove and [REDACTED] back and replace them with new, non-defective ones immediately.

I have experienced two fuel pump failures.  When the failures occur, the vehicle engine either dies or will not start.  When the first failure occurred, the dealer replaced the fuel pump under warranty and no attempt was made to determine the cause of the failure.

When the second failure occurred approximately two years later, I removed the fuel pump and determined that the failure was caused by a law voltage (12 volt) plug located inside the fuel tank.  This plug is completely surrounded by vaporized gasoline.  When it failed, the connection got hot enough to char the plastic surrounding the connection.   An electrical failure of  this nature could cause and electrical spark.  Since the plug that failed is located inside the fuel tank and is surrounded by gasoline vapors, the fuel pump failure creates a risk of fire and explosion.

I took the failed fuel pump to my Kawasaki dealer.  He had two other failed fuel pumps from the same model vehicle in his repair shop.  Both of these failed pumps showed over heating of the electrical plug that had failed on my vehicle.

We were traveling at only 5 mph over rugged terrain on a four-wheel drive trail in the Arapaho National Forest near Allenspark, CO. This section of the floor is just behind the front wheels of the vehicle and is constructed of thin plastic. Rocks, sticks, and other debris that are thrown from the front wheels often make contact with this plastic, which is the only material protecting the rider's lower body. This was the third incident in the past year where the foot rests have been smashed in on our vehicle. Both the driver and passenger sides are vulnerable to damage and is potentially a dangerous defect that could result in severe bodily injury. 

The dealer we bought the vehicle from has repaired the floor twice before but now they are refusing to do so because we are no longer covered under the warranty. They also are acting as if we are the only customers to ever experience this problem but that certainly is not the case.

We also contacted the complainant directly, who informed us that he had left the battery on the charger for 2 or 3 days, as was his custom, when the situation occurred.
Upon evaluation, the power transformer is fully functional, though a part of the plastic housing had melted onto the power strip.  The remaining parts are undamaged.
In infrequent situations, if a battery pack is left on the charger for more than a day, the transformer core may heat up due to misuse or due to excessive battery age.  This heat can soften the transformers plastic housing material, causing it to stick to the power strip.  Such heat is not a fire hazard; the plastic housing is certified under UL1310 standard (Class II power units), and its housing is certified with a V flammability rating under UL94 flammability.  The transformer was tested for flammability by Alltrade lab and verified that it met the requirement.  Similarly, the power strip into which it was plugged has 756-5VS flammability rating, certified under UL1363C standard.  This too was tested by Alltrade lab and verified that it met the requirement.  
Prolonged battery charging (overcharging) will shorten the battery life.  For this reason, Alltrade has affixed a permanent label on the charger stating, CAUTION  The charger will NOT automatically turn OFF when the battery pack becomes fully charged.  To prolong life, remove battery after 3 to 5 hours of recharging.  This warning remains on the charger that was returned to us by the complainant.  In addition, the instruction manual contains this same warning.
In conclusion, though the transformer plastic housing had partially melted, there was no fire danger as both the transformer and the power strip are non-flammable.

While using the drill in my garage to drill through thin plastic, I started smelling a burning smell.  I thought it was the plastic burning around the drill bit and kept drilling the holes.  The smell became very strong, and I noticed a lot of smoke coming out of the vent holes at the back of the drill.  I stopped using the drill and switched batteries, and made sure the forward, and speed switch were fully engaged.  I used the drill again and brown smoke started coming out of the drill.  I have not used the drill since.

The drill motor turns, but slower and makes a weird sound.  The closest thing I can relate to it is when you attempt to use the drill with a battery that is almost dead.  But these batteries were fully charged and hold a charge for hours.  I don't feel the batteries are the problem at all.

I bought a new drill and was going to sell the batteries and charger since they are still good.  When I did a search online I noticed a recall for Kawasaki drills model # [REDACTED].  The reason was for a bad switch.

I researched my model drill online and found that many have failed for the same reason, although I don't see complaints of smoke like mine.

I installed a set on my 2005 Kawasaki 750 Brute Force atv, and almost immediately recognized that the portion of the tube installed on the right handle bar was too narrow, and the inside of the bend in the tube was located where the throttle on the atv is located.  The result was that on several occasions, the mitt contacted and opened the throttle.  The first time this happened, my machine was in reverse and as I inserted my hand into the tube, the tube contacted the throttle opening it to near full, causing my machine to vigorously back up into a large tree.  There were several other instances where the tube contacted the throttle, and rather than discontinue use, I attempted to resolve the problem by insuring that my hand was over the throttle before putting my atv in gear.  This can only be accomplished by using the left hand to shift a shift mechanism located on the right side of the atv.  The last incident before I removed the mitts from my atv happened when I was attempting  to back out of a large snow drift on a road along a steep, deep slope.  As I backed up, I needed to use the right hand brake, and discovered that doing so caused the mitt to contact the throttle again, causing the atv to go vigorously backward.  I nearly went off the road over the edge of the steep slope before I regained control of the atv.  That is when I removed the mitt from the right handle bar, thinking it is better to have a cold hand that wreck my atv.

I have years of experience operating an atv in the Wind River Mountains of central Wyoming in all sorts of weather conditions.  I have never experienced the kind of loss of control the Geartector Mitt caused, and will not use the product again.  The actuation of the throttle can also be caused when the hand is inserted into the gauntlet if the user is not very careful.  

I strongly urge you to investigate this product because in the current design they can cause unintended actuation of the throttle and loss of control of the atv.

I called them the next day to speak to the supervisor or some one higher in the company, they told me they will get to me tomorrow.

Today they called, said same things , offering  ( $25) for the vehicle, and they came with other reason, saying because the batteries were replaced, so this modification is the cause for the fire, denying the known problem of their product. the batteries i put they were after market with same voltage ( 6 v ) and lesser ampere (7.5) the original were 9 . the vehicle worked many months after that till this incident happened

There is a recall already for this model number due to cords overheating but Lasko says my unit isn't included in the recall (I have exact same included model number but they say mine was manufactured 2006 and affected units were manufactured in 2005).
My unit power cord had apparently overheated an unknown number of times causing the outer covering of the power cord to disappear/burn away, exposing the metal wiring inside the power cord. This has caused the metal to spark and arc wildly when the cord was moved, which caused slight burns to the carpeting it was sitting on as well as my hands/fingers when I attempted to move the unit to unplug it.

The unit has not been damaged due to abuse or misuse.
This unit *should be included* in the recall regardless if it was manufactured 2005 or 2006 as my unit OBVIOUSLY has the same issue that prompted the recall.
I was told by Lasko to stop using it and throw it away and buy a new one  (I personally believe they just do not want to cover this one with a free replacement even though it is the same model number as the recall with the same issues).

I told the Asko representative that the dishwasher was installed by an authorized Asko installer and the wiring in my home which was built in 2008 was properly inspected by the local building department.

We have been using this space heater at home for the last few cold months.  Recently it was placed bedside.  Last night, I awoke to a strange, foul smell.  Without turning on the lights, I tried to locate the source of the smell -- and not thinking straight, simply turned off the heater and went back to bed.  Forgetting about this incident, I turned the heater on again tonight.  The odor appeared within minutes, and I immediately turned off the unit and located the odor source.  The heater plug is connected to a heavy duty extension cord which is plugged into the wall behind the headboard of my bed -- and where that connection lay on the carpet, both the plug and the carpet were melting/melted.  What I smelled were the fumes of melting carpet and plastic.  The plugs of both the unit and the extension cord are fused/melted together (unable to be separated) and the carpet has a burn the size of a ""cigarette burn.""

I reported this to Asko on December 9th in hope that any design flaw could be corrected and that any necessary recall completed, so that this does not happen to anyone else.

However, I believe there is an obvious problem, if it caught on fire.  Regarding compensation, they indicated that they would supply parts and I would be responsible for the labor to repair the dishwasher.

I paid the bill.  Bar dishwasher had recall kit replaced October 16, 2007.  On January 11, 2013 the kitchen dishwasher caught fire, smoke pouring out.  Smoke filled the kitchen, family room and bar.  We unplugged that dishwasher.  Since the dishwasher was 13 years old, we replaced it at our cost, but we were urged to notify ASKO due to the fire, and we had an email dated August 2, 2003 from ASKO certifying the dishwasher was safe to use.  I contacted ASKO.  First response was we did not have the recall kits installed.  I sent copies of the bill, pictures of the burnt dishwasher and email showing recall kit had been done, and email said it was safe to use.  Basically ASKO said it was not the company's responsibility.  I asked to have the dishwasher replaced in the bar, because it has the recall kit installed, and I am fearful it will catch on fire.  They refused to give us any  discount, money or help.  They tried to blame us for not having a recall kit installed, but I had proof we did follow the guidelines for the recall.  And even with the recall kit installed we still had a fire.  Fortunately we were at home and could unplug the dishwasher, and prevent the fire from spreading.

The pictures provided by the consumer indicate some type of component failure in and arond the door latch mechanism. Since ASKO was not afforded the chance to examine the unit we can not offer an explaination as to the cause. We can say that this incident was not in the area of the dishwasher as it relates to the voluntary recall. Based on the pictures provided it is clear that the incident was contained within the diswasher handle area as there is no visible indication of damage (flames) to the surronding counter or custom wood door. The insident could be attributed to moisture penetraing the handle area from run off of a spill on the counter or the use of a spray cleaner in and around the control panel. This is at best speculation as the unit in question was not made available for further inspection by the consumer.

I am a mechanical design engineer and want to make you aware of a serious problem with the design of your Galaxy Floor Stand Fan Type 16-1P, Style PCO 2586.
My wife was lowering the motor fan head and lost her grip on the upper metal post which resulted in the top section slamming down on her hand pinching it severely. There was much bleeding and pain and she had to go to the emergency room at her doctors advice to check to see if she needed stitches and to ascertain if there was any other damage to her hand. They treated her and advised her that her hand was blistered and cut but no other damage was indicated. She also required a Tetanus shot. She now has it bandaged. The charge to us was her $75 deductible Emergency Room co-pay which was more than double the price we paid for your fan.
As a side note, I have also been pinched by this fan in the past as I lowered it gently but did not sustain any injury.
This design flaw could be easily corrected if the tapered releasing collar had a flared collar to protect ones hand. Many other pole mounted products have this safety feature such as Beach Umbrellas.
I have attached a photo of the damage to her hand and a photo showing your fan pinch point problem along with a photo of a typical beach umbrella flared collar.
We now worry that a small child could reach up and twist the release handle. Since their hand is much smaller it potentially could slam down, smash and/or break their fingers and not just damage the soft tissue of their hand.
Please consider recalling this product and reimburse anyone that was injured by it.
I am copying this e-mail to the Consumer Product Safety Commission so they have a record of it.

I purchased an Asko WasherlDryer Combo -model WCAM1812 on March 31,2006 from Albert
Lee Appliances in Seattle, Washington for $1,169.00

After about a year, I noticed that whenever I tried to dry the clothes, after one hour they were
still damp or the other extreme was they were so hot that I had to let them cool down before
reaching in to take them out of the machine. The thing that was most puzzling about this was that
in spite of setting the drying time button to 20/40/0r 60 minutes that it was unpredictable how
dry the clothes were. Often the machine on dry would continue going even after I set it for only
20 minutes drying time.

I called the Asko on 10/27/08 and spoke with a woman name [REDACTED]. She had no record of
proof of purchase, so I gladly faxed a copy of my sales receipt. A month later, on 11/28/08 I
received a call from a woman name [REDACTED]. Her repeated questions to me were how much laundry
was I trying to dry at a time and perhaps I was ""filling the machine to the top"" which was not the
correct way to use the dryer. I explained to her that I was only using the dryer for sheet and
towels and never had a full load. Also, explained to her that because the sheets were queen size, I
would dry one sheet at a time. Towels were never more that 3-4 and were the regular size bath
towels. After much banter back and forth and her rude, demeaning manner, she agreed to make
arrangements to have a service person come out and take a look at the problem.

A male serviceman did come out shortly thereafter, opened the machine and his comment to me
was that I had a ""burned out heat pack"". He was even kind enough to show me the pack. I took a
picture of it while he had the top off the machine. He replaced the pack.

Problems continued with no control over the drying time regardless of what time setting I set the
dry knob on, and the clothes continued to come out not dried or the reverse of being so hot that I
could not touch them and sometimes I would pun them out of the machine, in spite of how hot
they were, for fear of a fire.

On June 19,2011, I put a load of clothing in the washing machine and noticed after one hour the
clothes were still on the wash cycle. I immediately called the Asko in a panic because I did not
know what to do since this had never happened before. I spoke with a very kind woman name
[REDACTED]. I explained to her what was going on. She talked me through a procedure that she said
would alleviate the problem, get the machine to go into spin and drain the water from the
machine. I tried 3 times with her on the phone but no results. The machine just kept washing in
the wash cycle. She was at a loss as to why the technique she was walking me through was not
working. She then suggested I pull the drain plug at the bottom ofthe machine and allow the
approx.5 gallons of water to drain. I told her I could not do that because the machine was not on
a platfonn, in other words the drain plug was too low to even slip an adequate bucket for the 5
gallons of water. I also explained to her that I was living in a condo with hardwood floors and
did not wish to damage my unit as well as my neighbors unit below me. She was very
sympathetic, apologized and gave me the number of a few repair companies in the area with the
understanding no one would be available to come out today. I thanked her for her time and we
hung up. The saving grace for me was that I kept repeating over and over the technique she tried
with me over the phone. It eventually worked.

I am very displeased with this product. There are definitely some safety issues and ooncerns as I
have documented. I would have to conclude that not only is Asko WasherlDryer Combo -Model
number WCAM 1812 - not a user friendly machine but that the drying component is a safety
hazard. We as consumers should not have to worry about using a product that is unreliable,
unsafe, or requires rebooting to operate.",,Unspecified,,Unspecified,"Incident, No Injury",Unspecified,Unspecified,,Yes,No,,,No,Yes,,,"(8/2/2011) ASKO Appliances Inc: We do not  find this to be an issue of safety but rather an issue of a consumer not happy with product performance.

It is a convenience piece so that consumers do not have to send out all of their laundry out or have to use a common laundry room all the time The product is an all in one washer/dryer meaning that clothes are washed and dried in the same drum. In order to get the best drying results in this product the loads are to be 1/2 size. Too large of loads will not dry completely and too small of a load could over dry. The drying system is an internal condensing system. As the garments dry the moisture in the air is condensed back into water, trapped and pump out through the drain system.

RE: Report of Product Defect and Information Request / Consumer: [REDACTED] / Date of Incident: 4/20/2018

I am writing to report an injury caused by a DeWalt pressure washer surface cleaner attachment. Here, after only a few uses, the nozzle connector separated from the tubing, tore through the protective cover and imbedded in the operator's foot. The surface cleaner attachment was purchased March 17, 2018 at a Home Depot store in Florence, Kentucky, breaking and causing the injury on April 20, 2018. See attached photographs.

Also, I am requesting information (FOIA request) regarding any other complaints or reports of injuries involving DeWalt pressure washer surface cleaner attachments or any other brands of pressure washer surface cleaner attachments.

I will pay all fees associated with fulfilling this request.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM CONSUMER:

On 9-26-12 my husband again called DeWalt and this time got a satisfactory response from a representative, [REDACTED].  [REDACTED] made an incident report,# [REDACTED], and told my husband [REDACTED], to send the cut off saw to DeWalt at [REDACTED], sent postage paid and as soon as he received it he would send [REDACTED],  a new DC411KA cut off saw, with a battery and cloth bag.  I told him I still planned to send this report so others who own the same model saw would be warned of the possible danger from this tool running its blade despite the tool being turned off.  He said to go ahead and do that but he wanted the tool back and he would replace it with the DC411KA, their newest tool like our DC410.  We will be satisfied with this response for [REDACTED], but still concerned for other who have this tool and might have it start going while it is turned off.  There was no prior warning of it acting up before this.
